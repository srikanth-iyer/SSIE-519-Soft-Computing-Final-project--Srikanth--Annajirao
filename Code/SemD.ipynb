She lingers my desiresLike to a stepdame or a dowagerLong withering out a young man\\'s revenue.HIPPOLYTAFour days will quickly steep themselves in night;Four nights will quickly dream away the time;And then the moon, like to a silver bowNew-bent in heaven, shall behold the nightOf our solemnities.THESEUS  Go, Philostrate,Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments.Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth.Turn melancholy forth to funerals;The pale companion is not for our pomp.[Philostrate exits.]Hippolyta, I wooed thee with my swordAnd won thy love doing thee injuries,But I will wed thee in another key,With pomp, with triumph, and with reveling.[Enter Egeus and his daughter Hermia, and Lysander  and Demetrius.]EGEUSHappy be Theseus, our renowned duke!THESEUSThanks, good Egeus. What\\'s the news with thee?EGEUSFull of vexation come I, with complaintAgainst my child, my daughter Hermia.--Stand forth, Demetrius.--My noble lord,This man hath my consent to marry her.--Stand forth, Lysander.--And, my gracious duke,This man hath bewitched the bosom of my child.--Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymesAnd interchanged love tokens with my child.Thou hast by moonlight at her window sungWith feigning voice verses of feigning loveAnd stol\\'n the impression of her fantasyWith bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits,Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats--messengersOf strong prevailment in unhardened youth.With cunning hast thou filched my daughter\\'s heart,Turned her obedience (which is due to me)To stubborn harshness.--And, my gracious duke,Be it so she will not here before your GraceConsent to marry with Demetrius,I beg the ancient privilege of Athens:As she is mine, I may dispose of her,Which shall be either to this gentlemanOr to her death, according to our lawImmediately provided in that case.THESEUSWhat say you, Hermia? Be advised, fair maid.To you, your father should be as a god,One that composed your beauties, yea, and oneTo whom you are but as a form in waxBy him imprinted, and within his powerTo leave the figure or disfigure it.Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.HERMIASo is Lysander.THESEUS  In himself he is,But in this kind, wanting your father\\'s voice,The other must be held the worthier.HERMIAI would my father looked but with my eyes.THESEUSRather your eyes must with his judgment look.HERMIAI do entreat your Grace to pardon me.I know not by what power I am made bold,Nor how it may concern my modestyIn such a presence here to plead my thoughts;But I beseech your Grace that I may knowThe worst that may befall me in this caseIf I refuse to wed Demetrius.THESEUSEither to die the death or to abjureForever the society of men.Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,Know of your youth, examine well your blood,Whether (if you yield not to your father\\'s choice)You can endure the livery of a nun,For aye to be in shady cloister mewed,To live a barren sister all your life,Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.Thrice-blessed they that master so their bloodTo undergo such maiden pilgrimage,But earthlier happy is the rose distilledThan that which, withering on the virgin thorn,Grows, lives, and dies in single blessedness.HERMIASo will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,Ere I will yield my virgin patent upUnto his Lordship whose unwished yokeMy soul consents not to give sovereignty.THESEUSTake time to pause, and by the next new moon(The sealing day betwixt my love and meFor everlasting bond of fellowship),Upon that day either prepare to dieFor disobedience to your father\\'s will,Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would,Or on Diana\\'s altar to protestFor aye austerity and single life.DEMETRIUSRelent, sweet Hermia, and, Lysander, yieldThy crazed title to my certain right.LYSANDERYou have her father\\'s love, Demetrius.Let me have Hermia\\'s. Do you marry him.EGEUSScornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;And what is mine my love shall render him.And she is mine, and all my right of herI do estate unto Demetrius.LYSANDER, [to Theseus]I am, my lord, as well derived as he,As well possessed. My love is more than his;My fortunes every way as fairly ranked(If not with vantage) as Demetrius\\';And (which is more than all these boasts can be)I am beloved of beauteous Hermia.Why should not I then prosecute my right?Demetrius, I\\'ll avouch it to his head,Made love to Nedar\\'s daughter, Helena,And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,Upon this spotted and inconstant man.THESEUSI must confess that I have heard so much,And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;But, being overfull of self-affairs,My mind did lose it.--But, Demetrius, come,And come, Egeus; you shall go with me.I have some private schooling for you both.--For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourselfTo fit your fancies to your father\\'s will,Or else the law of Athens yields you up(Which by no means we may extenuate)To death or to a vow of single life.--Come, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love?--Demetrius and Egeus, go along.I must employ you in some businessAgainst our nuptial and confer with youOf something nearly that concerns yourselves.EGEUSWith duty and desire we follow you.[All but Hermia and Lysander exit.]LYSANDERHow now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale?How chance the roses there do fade so fast?HERMIABelike for want of rain, which I could wellBeteem them from the tempest of my eyes.LYSANDERAy me! For aught that I could ever read,Could ever hear by tale or history,The course of true love never did run smooth.But either it was different in blood--HERMIAO cross! Too high to be enthralled to low.LYSANDEROr else misgraffed in respect of years--HERMIAO spite! Too old to be engaged to young.LYSANDEROr else it stood upon the choice of friends--HERMIAO hell, to choose love by another\\'s eyes!LYSANDEROr, if there were a sympathy in choice,War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,Making it momentany as a sound,Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,Brief as the lightning in the collied night,That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and Earth,And, ere a man hath power to say \"Behold!\"The jaws of darkness do devour it up.So quick bright things come to confusion.HERMIAIf then true lovers have been ever crossed,It stands as an edict in destiny.Then let us teach our trial patienceBecause it is a customary cross,As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,Wishes and tears, poor fancy\\'s followers.LYSANDERA good persuasion. Therefore, hear me, Hermia:I have a widow aunt, a dowagerOf great revenue, and she hath no child.From Athens is her house remote seven leagues,And she respects me as her only son.There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;And to that place the sharp Athenian lawCannot pursue us. If thou lovest me, thenSteal forth thy father\\'s house tomorrow night,And in the wood a league without the town(Where I did meet thee once with HelenaTo do observance to a morn of May),There will I stay for thee.HERMIA  My good Lysander,I swear to thee by Cupid\\'s strongest bow,By his best arrow with the golden head,By the simplicity of Venus\\' doves,By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,And by that fire which burned the Carthage queenWhen the false Trojan under sail was seen,By all the vows that ever men have broke(In number more than ever women spoke),In that same place thou hast appointed me,Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.LYSANDERKeep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.[Enter Helena.]HERMIAGodspeed, fair Helena. Whither away?HELENACall you me \"fair\"? That \"fair\" again unsay.Demetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!Your eyes are lodestars and your tongue\\'s sweet airMore tunable than lark to shepherd\\'s earWhen wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.Sickness is catching. O, were favor so!Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go.My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye;My tongue should catch your tongue\\'s sweetmelody.Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,The rest I\\'d give to be to you translated.O, teach me how you look and with what artYou sway the motion of Demetrius\\' heart!HERMIAI frown upon him, yet he loves me still.HELENAO, that your frowns would teach my smiles suchskill!HERMIAI give him curses, yet he gives me love.HELENAO, that my prayers could such affection move!HERMIAThe more I hate, the more he follows me.HELENAThe more I love, the more he hateth me.HERMIAHis folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.HELENANone but your beauty. Would that fault were mine!HERMIATake comfort: he no more shall see my face.Lysander and myself will fly this place.Before the time I did Lysander seeSeemed Athens as a paradise to me.O, then, what graces in my love do dwellThat he hath turned a heaven unto a hell!LYSANDERHelen, to you our minds we will unfold.Tomorrow night when Phoebe doth beholdHer silver visage in the wat\\'ry glass,Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass(A time that lovers\\' flights doth still conceal),Through Athens\\' gates have we devised to steal.HERMIAAnd in the wood where often you and IUpon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,There my Lysander and myself shall meetAnd thence from Athens turn away our eyesTo seek new friends and stranger companies.Farewell, sweet playfellow. Pray thou for us,And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius.--Keep word, Lysander. We must starve our sightFrom lovers\\' food till morrow deep midnight.LYSANDERI will, my Hermia.\\t[Hermia exits.]Helena, adieu.As you on him, Demetrius dote on you![Lysander exits.]HELENAHow happy some o\\'er other some can be!Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so.He will not know what all but he do know.And, as he errs, doting on Hermia\\'s eyes,So I, admiring of his qualities.Things base and vile, holding no quantity,Love can transpose to form and dignity.Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind;And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.Nor hath Love\\'s mind of any judgment taste.Wings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste.And therefore is Love said to be a childBecause in choice he is so oft beguiled.As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,So the boy Love is perjured everywhere.For, ere Demetrius looked on Hermia\\'s eyne,He hailed down oaths that he was only mine;And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,So he dissolved, and show\\'rs of oaths did melt.I will go tell him of fair Hermia\\'s flight.Then to the wood will he tomorrow nightPursue her. And, for this intelligenceIf I have thanks, it is a dear expense.But herein mean I to enrich my pain,To have his sight thither and back again.[She exits.]Scene 2=======[Enter Quince the carpenter, and Snug the joiner, andBottom the weaver, and Flute the bellows-mender, andSnout the tinker, and Starveling the tailor.]QUINCE  Is all our company here?BOTTOM  You were best to call them generally, man byman, according to the scrip.QUINCE  Here is the scroll of every man\\'s name whichis thought fit, through all Athens, to play in ourinterlude before the Duke and the Duchess on hiswedding day at night.BOTTOM  First, good Peter Quince, say what the playtreats on, then read the names of the actors, and sogrow to a point.QUINCE  Marry, our play is \"The most lamentablecomedy and most cruel death of Pyramus andThisbe.\"BOTTOM  A very good piece of work, I assure you, and amerry.

I\\'ll be gone.Our queen and all her elves come here anon.ROBINThe King doth keep his revels here tonight.Take heed the Queen come not within his sight,For Oberon is passing fell and wrathBecause that she, as her attendant, hathA lovely boy stolen from an Indian king;She never had so sweet a changeling.And jealous Oberon would have the childKnight of his train, to trace the forests wild.But she perforce withholds the loved boy,Crowns him with flowers and makes him all herjoy.And now they never meet in grove or green,By fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen,But they do square, that all their elves for fearCreep into acorn cups and hide them there.FAIRYEither I mistake your shape and making quite,Or else you are that shrewd and knavish spriteCalled Robin Goodfellow. Are not you heThat frights the maidens of the villagery,Skim milk, and sometimes labor in the quernAnd bootless make the breathless huswife churn,And sometime make the drink to bear no barm,Mislead night wanderers, laughing at their harm?Those that \"Hobgoblin\" call you and \"sweet Puck,\"You do their work, and they shall have good luck.Are not you he?ROBIN  Thou speakest aright.I am that merry wanderer of the night.I jest to Oberon and make him smileWhen I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,Neighing in likeness of a filly foal.And sometime lurk I in a gossip\\'s bowlIn very likeness of a roasted crab,And, when she drinks, against her lips I bobAnd on her withered dewlap pour the ale.The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;Then slip I from her bum, down topples sheAnd \"Tailor!\" cries and falls into a cough,And then the whole choir hold their hips and loffeAnd waxen in their mirth and neeze and swearA merrier hour was never wasted there.But room, fairy. Here comes Oberon.FAIRYAnd here my mistress. Would that he were gone![Enter Oberon the King of Fairies at one door, with histrain, and Titania the Queen at another, with hers.]OBERONIll met by moonlight, proud Titania.TITANIAWhat, jealous Oberon? Fairies, skip hence.I have forsworn his bed and company.OBERONTarry, rash wanton. Am not I thy lord?TITANIAThen I must be thy lady. But I knowWhen thou hast stolen away from FairylandAnd in the shape of Corin sat all dayPlaying on pipes of corn and versing loveTo amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,Come from the farthest steep of India,But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,Your buskined mistress and your warrior love,To Theseus must be wedded, and you comeTo give their bed joy and prosperity?OBERONHow canst thou thus for shame, Titania,Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?Didst not thou lead him through the glimmeringnightFrom Perigouna, whom he ravished,And make him with fair Aegles break his faith,With Ariadne and Antiopa?TITANIAThese are the forgeries of jealousy;And never, since the middle summer\\'s spring,Met we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,By paved fountain or by rushy brook,Or in the beached margent of the sea,To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,But with thy brawls thou hast disturbed our sport.Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,As in revenge have sucked up from the seaContagious fogs, which, falling in the land,Hath every pelting river made so proudThat they have overborne their continents.The ox hath therefore stretched his yoke in vain,The plowman lost his sweat, and the green cornHath rotted ere his youth attained a beard.The fold stands empty in the drowned field,And crows are fatted with the murrain flock.The nine-men\\'s-morris is filled up with mud,And the quaint mazes in the wanton green,For lack of tread, are undistinguishable.The human mortals want their winter here.No night is now with hymn or carol blessed.Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,Pale in her anger, washes all the air,That rheumatic diseases do abound.And thorough this distemperature we seeThe seasons alter: hoary-headed frostsFall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,And on old Hiems\\' thin and icy crownAn odorous chaplet of sweet summer budsIs, as in mockery, set. The spring, the summer,The childing autumn, angry winter, changeTheir wonted liveries, and the mazed worldBy their increase now knows not which is which.And this same progeny of evils comesFrom our debate, from our dissension;We are their parents and original.OBERONDo you amend it, then. It lies in you.Why should Titania cross her Oberon?I do but beg a little changeling boyTo be my henchman.TITANIA  Set your heart at rest:The Fairyland buys not the child of me.His mother was a vot\\'ress of my order,And in the spiced Indian air by nightFull often hath she gossiped by my sideAnd sat with me on Neptune\\'s yellow sands,Marking th\\' embarked traders on the flood,When we have laughed to see the sails conceiveAnd grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait,Following (her womb then rich with my youngsquire),Would imitate and sail upon the landTo fetch me trifles and return again,As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.But she, being mortal, of that boy did die,And for her sake do I rear up her boy,And for her sake I will not part with him.OBERONHow long within this wood intend you stay?TITANIAPerchance till after Theseus\\' wedding day.If you will patiently dance in our roundAnd see our moonlight revels, go with us.If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.OBERONGive me that boy and I will go with thee.TITANIANot for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away.We shall chide downright if I longer stay.[Titania and her fairies exit.]OBERONWell, go thy way. Thou shalt not from this groveTill I torment thee for this injury.--My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememb\\'restSince once I sat upon a promontoryAnd heard a mermaid on a dolphin\\'s backUttering such dulcet and harmonious breathThat the rude sea grew civil at her songAnd certain stars shot madly from their spheresTo hear the sea-maid\\'s music.ROBIN  I remember.OBERONThat very time I saw (but thou couldst not),Flying between the cold moon and the Earth,Cupid all armed. A certain aim he tookAt a fair vestal throned by the west,And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bowAs it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts.But I might see young Cupid\\'s fiery shaftQuenched in the chaste beams of the wat\\'ry moon,And the imperial vot\\'ress passed onIn maiden meditation, fancy-free.Yet marked I where the bolt of Cupid fell.It fell upon a little western flower,Before, milk-white, now purple with love\\'s wound,And maidens call it \"love-in-idleness.\"Fetch me that flower; the herb I showed thee once.The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laidWill make or man or woman madly doteUpon the next live creature that it sees.Fetch me this herb, and be thou here againEre the leviathan can swim a league.ROBINI\\'ll put a girdle round about the EarthIn forty minutes.\\t[He exits.]OBERON  Having once this juice,I\\'ll watch Titania when she is asleepAnd drop the liquor of it in her eyes.The next thing then she, waking, looks upon(Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,On meddling monkey, or on busy ape)She shall pursue it with the soul of love.And ere I take this charm from off her sight(As I can take it with another herb),I\\'ll make her render up her page to me.But who comes here? I am invisible,And I will overhear their conference.[Enter Demetrius, Helena following him.]DEMETRIUSI love thee not; therefore pursue me not.Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?The one I\\'ll stay; the other stayeth me.Thou told\\'st me they were stol\\'n unto this wood,And here am I, and wood within this woodBecause I cannot meet my Hermia.Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.HELENAYou draw me, you hard-hearted adamant!But yet you draw not iron, for my heartIs true as steel. Leave you your power to draw,And I shall have no power to follow you.DEMETRIUSDo I entice you? Do I speak you fair?Or rather do I not in plainest truthTell you I do not, nor I cannot love you?HELENAAnd even for that do I love you the more.I am your spaniel, and, Demetrius,The more you beat me I will fawn on you.Use me but as your spaniel: spurn me, strike me,Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave(Unworthy as I am) to follow you.What worser place can I beg in your love(And yet a place of high respect with me)Than to be used as you use your dog?DEMETRIUSTempt not too much the hatred of my spirit,For I am sick when I do look on thee.HELENAAnd I am sick when I look not on you.DEMETRIUSYou do impeach your modesty too muchTo leave the city and commit yourselfInto the hands of one that loves you not,To trust the opportunity of nightAnd the ill counsel of a desert placeWith the rich worth of your virginity.HELENAYour virtue is my privilege. For thatIt is not night when I do see your face,Therefore I think I am not in the night.Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,For you, in my respect, are all the world.Then, how can it be said I am aloneWhen all the world is here to look on me?DEMETRIUSI\\'ll run from thee and hide me in the brakesAnd leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.HELENAThe wildest hath not such a heart as you.Run when you will. The story shall be changed:Apollo flies and Daphne holds the chase;The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hindMakes speed to catch the tiger. Bootless speedWhen cowardice pursues and valor flies!DEMETRIUSI will not stay thy questions. Let me go,Or if thou follow me, do not believeBut I shall do thee mischief in the wood.HELENAAy, in the temple, in the town, the field,You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex.We cannot fight for love as men may do.We should be wooed and were not made to woo.[Demetrius exits.]I\\'ll follow thee and make a heaven of hellTo die upon the hand I love so well.\\t[Helena exits.]OBERONFare thee well, nymph. Ere he do leave this grove,Thou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love.[Enter Robin.]Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.ROBINAy, there it is.OBERON  I pray thee give it me.[Robin gives him the flower.]I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,Quite overcanopied with luscious woodbine,With sweet muskroses, and with eglantine.There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight.And there the snake throws her enameled skin,Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in.And with the juice of this I\\'ll streak her eyesAnd make her full of hateful fantasies.Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove.[He gives Robin part of the flower.]A sweet Athenian lady is in loveWith a disdainful youth.

Perforce I must confessI thought you lord of more true gentleness.O, that a lady of one man refusedShould of another therefore be abused!\\t[She exits.]LYSANDERShe sees not Hermia.--Hermia, sleep thou there,And never mayst thou come Lysander near.For, as a surfeit of the sweetest thingsThe deepest loathing to the stomach brings,Or as the heresies that men do leaveAre hated most of those they did deceive,So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,Of all be hated, but the most of me!And, all my powers, address your love and mightTo honor Helen and to be her knight.\\t[He exits.]HERMIA, [waking up]Help me, Lysander, help me! Do thy bestTo pluck this crawling serpent from my breast.Ay me, for pity! What a dream was here!Lysander, look how I do quake with fear.Methought a serpent ate my heart away,And you sat smiling at his cruel prey.Lysander! What, removed? Lysander, lord!What, out of hearing? Gone? No sound, no word?Alack, where are you? Speak, an if you hear.Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.--No? Then I well perceive you are not nigh.Either death or you I\\'ll find immediately.[She exits.]ACT 3=====Scene 1=======[With Titania still asleep onstage, enter the Clowns,Bottom, Quince, Snout, Starveling, Snug, and Flute.]BOTTOM  Are we all met?QUINCE  Pat, pat. And here\\'s a marvels convenientplace for our rehearsal. This green plot shall beour stage, this hawthorn brake our tiring-house,and we will do it in action as we will do it beforethe Duke.BOTTOM  Peter Quince?QUINCE  What sayest thou, bully Bottom?BOTTOM  There are things in this comedy of Pyramusand Thisbe that will never please. First, Pyramusmust draw a sword to kill himself, which the ladiescannot abide. How answer you that?SNOUT  By \\'r lakin, a parlous fear.STARVELING  I believe we must leave the killing out,when all is done.BOTTOM  Not a whit! I have a device to make all well.Write me a prologue, and let the prologue seem tosay we will do no harm with our swords and thatPyramus is not killed indeed. And, for the morebetter assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am notPyramus, but Bottom the weaver. This will put themout of fear.QUINCE  Well, we will have such a prologue, and it shallbe written in eight and six.BOTTOM  No, make it two more. Let it be written ineight and eight.SNOUT  Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?STARVELING  I fear it, I promise you.BOTTOM  Masters, you ought to consider with yourself,to bring in (God shield us!) a lion among ladies is amost dreadful thing. For there is not a more fearfulwildfowl than your lion living, and we ought to lookto \\'t.SNOUT  Therefore another prologue must tell he is nota lion.BOTTOM  Nay, you must name his name, and half hisface must be seen through the lion\\'s neck, and hehimself must speak through, saying thus, or to thesame defect: \"Ladies,\" or \"Fair ladies, I wouldwish you,\" or \"I would request you,\" or \"I wouldentreat you not to fear, not to tremble! My life foryours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it werepity of my life. No, I am no such thing. I am a man asother men are.\" And there indeed let him name hisname and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.QUINCE  Well, it shall be so. But there is two hardthings: that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber,for you know Pyramus and Thisbe meet bymoonlight.SNOUT  Doth the moon shine that night we play ourplay?BOTTOM  A calendar, a calendar! Look in the almanac.Find out moonshine, find out moonshine.[Quince takes out a book.]QUINCE  Yes, it doth shine that night.BOTTOM  Why, then, may you leave a casement of thegreat chamber window, where we play, open, andthe moon may shine in at the casement.QUINCE  Ay, or else one must come in with a bush ofthorns and a lantern and say he comes to disfigureor to present the person of Moonshine. Then thereis another thing: we must have a wall in the greatchamber, for Pyramus and Thisbe, says the story,did talk through the chink of a wall.SNOUT  You can never bring in a wall. What say you,Bottom?BOTTOM  Some man or other must present Wall. Andlet him have some plaster, or some loam, or someroughcast about him to signify wall, or let himhold his fingers thus, and through that cranny shallPyramus and Thisbe whisper.QUINCE  If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down,every mother\\'s son, and rehearse your parts. Pyramus,you begin. When you have spoken yourspeech, enter into that brake, and so everyoneaccording to his cue.[Enter Robin invisible to those onstage.]ROBIN, [aside]What hempen homespuns have we swagg\\'ring hereSo near the cradle of the Fairy Queen?What, a play toward?

It is \"never tire.\"FLUTE  O![As Thisbe.] As true as truest horse, that yet would nevertire.[Enter Robin, and Bottom as Pyramus with theass-head.]BOTTOM, [as Pyramus]\\tIf I were fair, fair Thisbe, I were only thine.QUINCE  O monstrous!

This is to make an ass ofme, to fright me, if they could. But I will not stirfrom this place, do what they can.

And yet, to say the truth, reasonand love keep little company together nowadays.The more the pity that some honest neighbors willnot make them friends. Nay, I can gleek uponoccasion.TITANIAThou art as wise as thou art beautiful.BOTTOM  Not so neither; but if I had wit enough to getout of this wood, I have enough to serve mine ownturn.TITANIAOut of this wood do not desire to go.Thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no.I am a spirit of no common rate.The summer still doth tend upon my state,And I do love thee.

Bring him silently.[They exit.]Scene 2=======[Enter Oberon, King of Fairies.]OBERONI wonder if Titania be awaked;Then what it was that next came in her eye,Which she must dote on in extremity.[Enter Robin Goodfellow.]Here comes my messenger. How now, mad spirit?What night-rule now about this haunted grove?ROBINMy mistress with a monster is in love.Near to her close and consecrated bower,While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,Were met together to rehearse a playIntended for great Theseus\\' nuptial day.The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,Who Pyramus presented in their sport,Forsook his scene and entered in a brake.When I did him at this advantage take,An ass\\'s noll I fixed on his head.Anon his Thisbe must be answered,And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,Rising and cawing at the gun\\'s report,Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,So at his sight away his fellows fly,And, at our stamp, here o\\'er and o\\'er one falls.He \"Murder\" cries and help from Athens calls.Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears thusstrong,Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch,Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all thingscatch.I led them on in this distracted fearAnd left sweet Pyramus translated there.When in that moment, so it came to pass,Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.OBERONThis falls out better than I could devise.But hast thou yet latched the Athenian\\'s eyesWith the love juice, as I did bid thee do?ROBINI took him sleeping--that is finished, too--And the Athenian woman by his side,That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.[Enter Demetrius and Hermia.]OBERONStand close. This is the same Athenian.ROBINThis is the woman, but not this the man.[They step aside.]DEMETRIUSO, why rebuke you him that loves you so?Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe!HERMIANow I but chide, but I should use thee worse,For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse.If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,Being o\\'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deepAnd kill me too.The sun was not so true unto the dayAs he to me. Would he have stolen awayFrom sleeping Hermia? I\\'ll believe as soonThis whole Earth may be bored, and that the moonMay through the center creep and so displeaseHer brother\\'s noontide with th\\' Antipodes.It cannot be but thou hast murdered him.So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.DEMETRIUSSo should the murdered look, and so should I,Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty.Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.HERMIAWhat\\'s this to my Lysander? Where is he?Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?DEMETRIUSI had rather give his carcass to my hounds.HERMIAOut, dog! Out, cur! Thou driv\\'st me past the boundsOf maiden\\'s patience. Hast thou slain him, then?Henceforth be never numbered among men.O, once tell true! Tell true, even for my sake!Durst thou have looked upon him, being awake?And hast thou killed him sleeping? O brave touch!Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?An adder did it, for with doubler tongueThan thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.DEMETRIUSYou spend your passion on a misprised mood.I am not guilty of Lysander\\'s blood,Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.HERMIAI pray thee, tell me then that he is well.DEMETRIUSAn if I could, what should I get therefor?HERMIAA privilege never to see me more.And from thy hated presence part I so.See me no more, whether he be dead or no.[She exits.]DEMETRIUSThere is no following her in this fierce vein.Here, therefore, for a while I will remain.So sorrow\\'s heaviness doth heavier growFor debt that bankrout sleep doth sorrow owe,Which now in some slight measure it will pay,If for his tender here I make some stay.[He lies down and falls asleep.]OBERON, [to Robin]What hast thou done? Thou hast mistaken quiteAnd laid the love juice on some true-love\\'s sight.Of thy misprision must perforce ensueSome true-love turned, and not a false turned true.ROBINThen fate o\\'errules, that, one man holding troth,A million fail, confounding oath on oath.OBERONAbout the wood go swifter than the wind,And Helena of Athens look thou find.All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheerWith sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear.By some illusion see thou bring her here.I\\'ll charm his eyes against she do appear.ROBIN  I go, I go, look how I go,Swifter than arrow from the Tartar\\'s bow.\\t[He exits.]OBERON, [applying the nectar to Demetrius\\' eyes]\\tFlower of this purple dye,\\tHit with Cupid\\'s archery,\\tSink in apple of his eye.\\tWhen his love he doth espy,\\tLet her shine as gloriously\\tAs the Venus of the sky.--\\tWhen thou wak\\'st, if she be by,\\tBeg of her for remedy.[Enter Robin.]ROBIN\\tCaptain of our fairy band,\\tHelena is here at hand,\\tAnd the youth, mistook by me,\\tPleading for a lover\\'s fee.\\tShall we their fond pageant see?\\tLord, what fools these mortals be!OBERON\\tStand aside. The noise they make\\tWill cause Demetrius to awake.ROBIN\\tThen will two at once woo one.\\tThat must needs be sport alone.\\tAnd those things do best please me\\tThat befall prepost\\'rously.[They step aside.][Enter Lysander and Helena.]LYSANDERWhy should you think that I should woo in scorn?   Scorn and derision never come in tears.Look when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,   In their nativity all truth appears.How can these things in me seem scorn to you,Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true?HELENAYou do advance your cunning more and more.   When truth kills truth, O devilish holy fray!These vows are Hermia\\'s. Will you give her o\\'er?   Weigh oath with oath and you will nothing   weigh.Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,Will even weigh, and both as light as tales.LYSANDERI had no judgment when to her I swore.HELENANor none, in my mind, now you give her o\\'er.LYSANDERDemetrius loves her, and he loves not you.DEMETRIUS, [waking up]O Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in showThy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!That pure congealed white, high Taurus\\' snow,Fanned with the eastern wind, turns to a crowWhen thou hold\\'st up thy hand. O, let me kissThis princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!HELENAO spite! O hell! I see you all are bentTo set against me for your merriment.If you were civil and knew courtesy,You would not do me thus much injury.Can you not hate me, as I know you do,But you must join in souls to mock me too?If you were men, as men you are in show,You would not use a gentle lady so,To vow and swear and superpraise my parts,When, I am sure, you hate me with your hearts.You both are rivals and love Hermia,And now both rivals to mock Helena.A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,To conjure tears up in a poor maid\\'s eyesWith your derision! None of noble sortWould so offend a virgin and extortA poor soul\\'s patience, all to make you sport.LYSANDERYou are unkind, Demetrius. Be not so,For you love Hermia; this you know I know.And here with all goodwill, with all my heart,In Hermia\\'s love I yield you up my part.And yours of Helena to me bequeath,Whom I do love and will do till my death.HELENANever did mockers waste more idle breath.DEMETRIUSLysander, keep thy Hermia. I will none.If e\\'er I loved her, all that love is gone.My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourned,And now to Helen is it home returned,There to remain.LYSANDER  Helen, it is not so.DEMETRIUSDisparage not the faith thou dost not know,Lest to thy peril thou aby it dear.Look where thy love comes. Yonder is thy dear.[Enter Hermia.]HERMIA, [to Lysander]Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,The ear more quick of apprehension makes;Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,It pays the hearing double recompense.Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound.But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?LYSANDERWhy should he stay whom love doth press to go?HERMIAWhat love could press Lysander from my side?LYSANDERLysander\\'s love, that would not let him bide,Fair Helena, who more engilds the nightThan all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.Why seek\\'st thou me? Could not this make theeknowThe hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?HERMIAYou speak not as you think. It cannot be.HELENALo, she is one of this confederacy!Now I perceive they have conjoined all threeTo fashion this false sport in spite of me.--Injurious Hermia, most ungrateful maid,Have you conspired, have you with these contrived,To bait me with this foul derision?Is all the counsel that we two have shared,The sisters\\' vows, the hours that we have spentWhen we have chid the hasty-footed timeFor parting us--O, is all forgot?All schooldays\\' friendship, childhood innocence?We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,Have with our needles created both one flower,Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,Both warbling of one song, both in one key,As if our hands, our sides, voices, and mindsHad been incorporate. So we grew togetherLike to a double cherry, seeming parted,But yet an union in partition,Two lovely berries molded on one stem;So with two seeming bodies but one heart,Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,Due but to one, and crowned with one crest.And will you rent our ancient love asunder,To join with men in scorning your poor friend?It is not friendly; \\'tis not maidenly.Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,Though I alone do feel the injury.HERMIAI am amazed at your words.I scorn you not. It seems that you scorn me.HELENAHave you not set Lysander, as in scorn,To follow me and praise my eyes and face,And made your other love, Demetrius,Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he thisTo her he hates? And wherefore doth LysanderDeny your love (so rich within his soul)And tender me, forsooth, affection,But by your setting on, by your consent?What though I be not so in grace as you,So hung upon with love, so fortunate,But miserable most, to love unloved?This you should pity rather than despise.HERMIAI understand not what you mean by this.HELENAAy, do. Persever, counterfeit sad looks,Make mouths upon me when I turn my back,Wink each at other, hold the sweet jest up.This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.If you have any pity, grace, or manners,You would not make me such an argument.But fare you well. \\'Tis partly my own fault,Which death or absence soon shall remedy.LYSANDERStay, gentle Helena. Hear my excuse,My love, my life, my soul, fair Helena.HELENAO excellent!HERMIA, [to Lysander]Sweet, do not scorn her so.DEMETRIUS, [to Lysander]If she cannot entreat, I can compel.LYSANDERThou canst compel no more than she entreat.Thy threats have no more strength than her weakprayers.--Helen, I love thee. By my life, I do.I swear by that which I will lose for thee,To prove him false that says I love thee not.DEMETRIUSI say I love thee more than he can do.LYSANDERIf thou say so, withdraw and prove it too.DEMETRIUSQuick, come.HERMIA  Lysander, whereto tends all this?[She takes hold of Lysander.]LYSANDERAway, you Ethiop!DEMETRIUS, [to Hermia]No, no. He\\'llSeem to break loose. [To Lysander.] Take on as youwould follow,But yet come not. You are a tame man, go!LYSANDER, [to Hermia]Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! Vile thing, let loose,Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent.HERMIAWhy are you grown so rude? What change is this,Sweet love?LYSANDER  Thy love? Out, tawny Tartar, out!Out, loathed med\\'cine! O, hated potion, hence!HERMIADo you not jest?HELENA  Yes, sooth, and so do you.LYSANDERDemetrius, I will keep my word with thee.DEMETRIUSI would I had your bond. For I perceiveA weak bond holds you. I\\'ll not trust your word.LYSANDERWhat? Should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?Although I hate her, I\\'ll not harm her so.HERMIAWhat, can you do me greater harm than hate?Hate me? Wherefore? O me, what news, my love?Am not I Hermia? Are not you Lysander?I am as fair now as I was erewhile.Since night you loved me; yet since night you leftme.Why, then, you left me--O, the gods forbid!--In earnest, shall I say?LYSANDER  Ay, by my life,And never did desire to see thee more.Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt.Be certain, nothing truer, \\'tis no jestThat I do hate thee and love Helena.[Hermia turns him loose.]HERMIAO me! [To Helena.] You juggler, you cankerblossom,You thief of love! What, have you come by nightAnd stol\\'n my love\\'s heart from him?HELENA  Fine, i\\' faith.Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tearImpatient answers from my gentle tongue?Fie, fie, you counterfeit, you puppet, you!HERMIA\"Puppet\"? Why so? Ay, that way goes the game.Now I perceive that she hath made compareBetween our statures; she hath urged her height,And with her personage, her tall personage,Her height, forsooth, she hath prevailed with him.And are you grown so high in his esteemBecause I am so dwarfish and so low?How low am I, thou painted maypole? Speak!How low am I? I am not yet so lowBut that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.HELENAI pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,Let her not hurt me. I was never curst;I have no gift at all in shrewishness.I am a right maid for my cowardice.Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,Because she is something lower than myself,That I can match her.HERMIA  \"Lower\"? Hark, again!HELENAGood Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.I evermore did love you, Hermia,Did ever keep your counsels, never wronged you--Save that, in love unto Demetrius,I told him of your stealth unto this wood.He followed you; for love, I followed him.But he hath chid me hence and threatened meTo strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too.And now, so you will let me quiet go,To Athens will I bear my folly backAnd follow you no further. Let me go.You see how simple and how fond I am.HERMIAWhy, get you gone. Who is \\'t that hinders you?HELENAA foolish heart that I leave here behind.HERMIAWhat, with Lysander?HELENA  With Demetrius.LYSANDERBe not afraid. She shall not harm thee, Helena.DEMETRIUSNo, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.HELENAO, when she is angry, she is keen and shrewd.She was a vixen when she went to school,And though she be but little, she is fierce.HERMIA\"Little\" again? Nothing but \"low\" and \"little\"?Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?Let me come to her.LYSANDER  Get you gone, you dwarf,You minimus of hind\\'ring knotgrass made,You bead, you acorn--DEMETRIUS  You are too officiousIn her behalf that scorns your services.Let her alone. Speak not of Helena.Take not her part. For if thou dost intendNever so little show of love to her,Thou shalt aby it.LYSANDER  Now she holds me not.Now follow, if thou dar\\'st, to try whose right,Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.DEMETRIUS\"Follow\"? Nay, I\\'ll go with thee, cheek by jowl.[Demetrius and Lysander exit.]HERMIAYou, mistress, all this coil is long of you.[Helena retreats.]Nay, go not back.HELENA  I will not trust you, I,Nor longer stay in your curst company.Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray.My legs are longer though, to run away.\\t[She exits.]HERMIAI am amazed and know not what to say.\\t[She exits.]OBERON, [to Robin]This is thy negligence. Still thou mistak\\'st,Or else committ\\'st thy knaveries willfully.ROBINBelieve me, king of shadows, I mistook.Did not you tell me I should know the manBy the Athenian garments he had on?And so far blameless proves my enterpriseThat I have \\'nointed an Athenian\\'s eyes;And so far am I glad it so did sort,As this their jangling I esteem a sport.OBERONThou seest these lovers seek a place to fight.Hie, therefore, Robin, overcast the night;The starry welkin cover thou anonWith drooping fog as black as Acheron,And lead these testy rivals so astrayAs one come not within another\\'s way.Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue;Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong.And sometime rail thou like Demetrius.And from each other look thou lead them thus,Till o\\'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleepWith leaden legs and batty wings doth creep.Then crush this herb into Lysander\\'s eye,[He gives a flower to Robin.]Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,To take from thence all error with his mightAnd make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.When they next wake, all this derisionShall seem a dream and fruitless vision.And back to Athens shall the lovers wend,With league whose date till death shall never end.Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,I\\'ll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;And then I will her charmed eye releaseFrom monster\\'s view, and all things shall be peace.ROBINMy fairy lord, this must be done with haste,For night\\'s swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,And yonder shines Aurora\\'s harbinger,At whose approach, ghosts wand\\'ring here andthereTroop home to churchyards. Damned spirits all,That in crossways and floods have burial,Already to their wormy beds are gone.For fear lest day should look their shames upon,They willfully themselves exile from lightAnd must for aye consort with black-browed night.OBERONBut we are spirits of another sort.I with the Morning\\'s love have oft made sportAnd, like a forester, the groves may treadEven till the eastern gate, all fiery red,Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,Turns into yellow gold his salt-green streams.But notwithstanding, haste! Make no delay.We may effect this business yet ere day.\\t[He exits.]ROBIN\\tUp and down, up and down,\\tI will lead them up and down.\\tI am feared in field and town.\\tGoblin, lead them up and down.Here comes one.[Enter Lysander.]LYSANDERWhere art thou, proud Demetrius? Speak thou now.ROBIN, [in Demetrius\\' voice]Here, villain, drawn and ready. Where art thou?LYSANDER  I will be with thee straight.ROBIN, [in Demetrius\\' voice]  Follow me, then, toplainer ground.\\t[Lysander exits.][Enter Demetrius.]DEMETRIUS  Lysander, speak again.Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?Speak!

Seest thou this sweet sight?Her dotage now I do begin to pity.For, meeting her of late behind the wood,Seeking sweet favors for this hateful fool,I did upbraid her and fall out with her.For she his hairy temples then had roundedWith coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;And that same dew, which sometime on the budsWas wont to swell like round and orient pearls,Stood now within the pretty flouriets\\' eyes,Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.When I had at my pleasure taunted her,And she in mild terms begged my patience,I then did ask of her her changeling child,Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sentTo bear him to my bower in Fairyland.And now I have the boy, I will undoThis hateful imperfection of her eyes.And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalpFrom off the head of this Athenian swain,That he, awaking when the other do,May all to Athens back again repairAnd think no more of this night\\'s accidentsBut as the fierce vexation of a dream.But first I will release the Fairy Queen.[He applies the nectar to her eyes.]\\tBe as thou wast wont to be.\\tSee as thou wast wont to see.\\tDian\\'s bud o\\'er Cupid\\'s flower\\tHath such force and blessed power.Now, my Titania, wake you, my sweet queen.TITANIA, [waking]My Oberon, what visions have I seen!Methought I was enamored of an ass.OBERONThere lies your love.TITANIA  How came these things to pass?O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!OBERONSilence awhile.--Robin, take off this head.--Titania, music call; and strike more deadThan common sleep of all these five the sense.TITANIAMusic, ho, music such as charmeth sleep!ROBIN, [removing the ass-head from Bottom]Now, when thou wak\\'st, with thine own fool\\'s eyespeep.OBERONSound music.\\t[Music.]Come, my queen, take hands with me,And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.[Titania and Oberon dance.]Now thou and I are new in amity,And will tomorrow midnight solemnlyDance in Duke Theseus\\' house triumphantly,And bless it to all fair prosperity.There shall the pairs of faithful lovers beWedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.ROBIN\\tFairy king, attend and mark.\\tI do hear the morning lark.OBERON\\tThen, my queen, in silence sad\\tTrip we after night\\'s shade.\\tWe the globe can compass soon,\\tSwifter than the wand\\'ring moon.TITANIA\\tCome, my lord, and in our flight\\tTell me how it came this night\\tThat I sleeping here was found\\tWith these mortals on the ground.[Oberon, Robin, and Titania exit.][Wind horn.

Never did I hearSuch gallant chiding, for, besides the groves,The skies, the fountains, every region nearSeemed all one mutual cry. I never heardSo musical a discord, such sweet thunder.THESEUSMy hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,So flewed, so sanded; and their heads are hungWith ears that sweep away the morning dew;Crook-kneed, and dewlapped like Thessalian bulls;Slow in pursuit, but matched in mouth like bells,Each under each. A cry more tunableWas never holloed to, nor cheered with horn,In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly.Judge when you hear.--But soft! What nymphs arethese?EGEUSMy lord, this is my daughter here asleep,And this Lysander; this Demetrius is,This Helena, old Nedar\\'s Helena.I wonder of their being here together.THESEUSNo doubt they rose up early to observeThe rite of May, and hearing our intent,Came here in grace of our solemnity.But speak, Egeus. Is not this the dayThat Hermia should give answer of her choice?EGEUS  It is, my lord.THESEUSGo, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.[A Servant exits.][Shout within. Wind horns. They all start up.]THESEUSGood morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past.Begin these woodbirds but to couple now?[Demetrius, Helena, Hermia, and Lysander kneel.]LYSANDERPardon, my lord.THESEUS  I pray you all, stand up.[They rise.]I know you two are rival enemies.How comes this gentle concord in the world,That hatred is so far from jealousyTo sleep by hate and fear no enmity?LYSANDERMy lord, I shall reply amazedly,Half sleep, half waking. But as yet, I swear,I cannot truly say how I came here.But, as I think--for truly would I speak,And now I do bethink me, so it is:I came with Hermia hither. Our intentWas to be gone from Athens, where we might,Without the peril of the Athenian law--EGEUSEnough, enough!--My lord, you have enough.I beg the law, the law upon his head.They would have stol\\'n away.--They would,Demetrius,Thereby to have defeated you and me:You of your wife and me of my consent,Of my consent that she should be your wife.DEMETRIUSMy lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,Of this their purpose hither to this wood,And I in fury hither followed them,Fair Helena in fancy following me.But, my good lord, I wot not by what power(But by some power it is) my love to Hermia,Melted as the snow, seems to me nowAs the remembrance of an idle gaudWhich in my childhood I did dote upon,And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,The object and the pleasure of mine eye,Is only Helena. To her, my lord,Was I betrothed ere I saw Hermia.But like a sickness did I loathe this food.But, as in health, come to my natural taste,Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,And will forevermore be true to it.THESEUSFair lovers, you are fortunately met.Of this discourse we more will hear anon.--Egeus, I will overbear your will,For in the temple by and by, with us,These couples shall eternally be knit.--And, for the morning now is something worn,Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.Away with us to Athens. Three and three,We\\'ll hold a feast in great solemnity.Come, Hippolyta.[Theseus and his train,including Hippolyta and Egeus, exit.]DEMETRIUSThese things seem small and undistinguishable,Like far-off mountains turned into clouds.HERMIAMethinks I see these things with parted eye,When everything seems double.HELENA  So methinks.And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,Mine own and not mine own.DEMETRIUS  Are you sureThat we are awake? It seems to meThat yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you thinkThe Duke was here and bid us follow him?HERMIAYea, and my father.HELENA  And Hippolyta.LYSANDERAnd he did bid us follow to the temple.DEMETRIUSWhy, then, we are awake. Let\\'s follow him,And by the way let us recount our dreams.[Lovers exit.]BOTTOM, [waking up]   When my cue comes, call me,and I will answer. My next is \"Most fair Pyramus.\"Hey-ho! Peter Quince! Flute the bellows-mender!Snout the tinker! Starveling! God\\'s my life! Stolenhence and left me asleep! I have had a most rarevision. I have had a dream past the wit of man to saywhat dream it was. Man is but an ass if he go aboutto expound this dream. Methought I was--thereis no man can tell what. Methought I was andmethought I had--but man is but a patched fool ifhe will offer to say what methought I had. The eye ofman hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen,man\\'s hand is not able to taste, his tongue toconceive, nor his heart to report what my dreamwas. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of thisdream. It shall be called \"Bottom\\'s Dream\" becauseit hath no bottom; and I will sing it in thelatter end of a play, before the Duke. Peradventure,to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at herdeath.[He exits.]Scene 2=======[Enter Quince, Flute, Snout, and Starveling.]QUINCE  Have you sent to Bottom\\'s house? Is he comehome yet?STARVELING  He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt heis transported.FLUTE  If he come not, then the play is marred. It goesnot forward, doth it?QUINCE  It is not possible. You have not a man in allAthens able to discharge Pyramus but he.FLUTE  No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraftmanin Athens.QUINCE  Yea, and the best person too, and he is a veryparamour for a sweet voice.FLUTE  You must say \"paragon.\" A \"paramour\" is (Godbless us) a thing of naught.[Enter Snug the joiner.]SNUG  Masters, the Duke is coming from the temple,and there is two or three lords and ladies moremarried. If our sport had gone forward, we had allbeen made men.FLUTE  O, sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpencea day during his life. He could not have\\'scaped sixpence a day. An the Duke had not givenhim sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I\\'ll behanged. He would have deserved it. Sixpence a dayin Pyramus, or nothing![Enter Bottom.]BOTTOM  Where are these lads? Where are thesehearts?QUINCE  Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happyhour!BOTTOM  Masters, I am to discourse wonders. But askme not what; for, if I tell you, I am not trueAthenian. I will tell you everything right as it fellout.QUINCE  Let us hear, sweet Bottom.BOTTOM  Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is thatthe Duke hath dined. Get your apparel together,good strings to your beards, new ribbons to yourpumps. Meet presently at the palace. Every manlook o\\'er his part. For the short and the long is, ourplay is preferred. In any case, let Thisbe have cleanlinen, and let not him that plays the lion pare hisnails, for they shall hang out for the lion\\'s claws.And, most dear actors, eat no onions nor garlic, forwe are to utter sweet breath, and I do not doubt butto hear them say it is a sweet comedy. No morewords. Away! Go, away![They exit.]ACT 5=====Scene 1=======[Enter Theseus, Hippolyta, and Philostrate, Lords, andAttendants.]HIPPOLYTA\\'Tis strange, my Theseus, that these lovers speak of.THESEUSMore strange than true. I never may believeThese antique fables nor these fairy toys.Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,Such shaping fantasies, that apprehendMore than cool reason ever comprehends.The lunatic, the lover, and the poetAre of imagination all compact.One sees more devils than vast hell can hold:That is the madman. The lover, all as frantic,Sees Helen\\'s beauty in a brow of Egypt.The poet\\'s eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,Doth glance from heaven to Earth, from Earth toheaven,And as imagination bodies forthThe forms of things unknown, the poet\\'s penTurns them to shapes and gives to airy nothingA local habitation and a name.Such tricks hath strong imaginationThat, if it would but apprehend some joy,It comprehends some bringer of that joy.Or in the night, imagining some fear,How easy is a bush supposed a bear!HIPPOLYTABut all the story of the night told over,And all their minds transfigured so together,More witnesseth than fancy\\'s imagesAnd grows to something of great constancy,But, howsoever, strange and admirable.[Enter Lovers: Lysander, Demetrius, Hermia, and Helena.]THESEUSHere come the lovers full of joy and mirth.--Joy, gentle friends! Joy and fresh days of loveAccompany your hearts!LYSANDER  More than to usWait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!THESEUSCome now, what masques, what dances shall wehaveTo wear away this long age of three hoursBetween our after-supper and bedtime?Where is our usual manager of mirth?What revels are in hand? Is there no playTo ease the anguish of a torturing hour?Call Philostrate.PHILOSTRATE, [coming forward]  Here, mighty Theseus.THESEUSSay what abridgment have you for this evening,What masque, what music? How shall we beguileThe lazy time if not with some delight?PHILOSTRATE, [giving Theseus a paper]There is a brief how many sports are ripe.Make choice of which your Highness will see first.THESEUS\"The battle with the Centaurs, to be sungBy an Athenian eunuch to the harp.\"We\\'ll none of that. That have I told my loveIn glory of my kinsman Hercules.\"The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.\"That is an old device, and it was playedWhen I from Thebes came last a conqueror.\"The thrice-three Muses mourning for the deathOf learning, late deceased in beggary.\"That is some satire, keen and critical,Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.\"A tedious brief scene of young PyramusAnd his love Thisbe, very tragical mirth.\"\"Merry\" and \"tragical\"? \"Tedious\" and \"brief\"?That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow!How shall we find the concord of this discord?PHILOSTRATEA play there is, my lord, some ten words long(Which is as brief as I have known a play),But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,Which makes it tedious; for in all the play,There is not one word apt, one player fitted.And tragical, my noble lord, it is.For Pyramus therein doth kill himself,Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,Made mine eyes water; but more merry tearsThe passion of loud laughter never shed.THESEUSWhat are they that do play it?PHILOSTRATEHard-handed men that work in Athens here,Which never labored in their minds till now,And now have toiled their unbreathed memoriesWith this same play, against your nuptial.THESEUSAnd we will hear it.PHILOSTRATE  No, my noble lord,It is not for you. I have heard it over,And it is nothing, nothing in the world,Unless you can find sport in their intents,Extremely stretched and conned with cruel painTo do you service.THESEUS  I will hear that play,For never anything can be amissWhen simpleness and duty tender it.Go, bring them in--and take your places, ladies.[Philostrate exits.]HIPPOLYTAI love not to see wretchedness o\\'ercharged,And duty in his service perishing.THESEUSWhy, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.HIPPOLYTAHe says they can do nothing in this kind.THESEUSThe kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.Our sport shall be to take what they mistake;And what poor duty cannot do, noble respectTakes it in might, not merit.Where I have come, great clerks have purposedTo greet me with premeditated welcomes,Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,Make periods in the midst of sentences,Throttle their practiced accent in their fears,And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,Out of this silence yet I picked a welcome,And in the modesty of fearful duty,I read as much as from the rattling tongueOf saucy and audacious eloquence.Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicityIn least speak most, to my capacity.[Enter Philostrate.]PHILOSTRATESo please your Grace, the Prologue is addressed.THESEUS  Let him approach.[Enter the Prologue.]PROLOGUEIf we offend, it is with our goodwill.   That you should think we come not to offend,But with goodwill. To show our simple skill,   That is the true beginning of our end.Consider, then, we come but in despite.   We do not come, as minding to content you,Our true intent is. All for your delight   We are not here. That you should here repent   you,The actors are at hand, and, by their show,You shall know all that you are like to know.[Prologue exits.]THESEUS  This fellow doth not stand upon points.LYSANDER  He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt;he knows not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it isnot enough to speak, but to speak true.HIPPOLYTA  Indeed he hath played on this prologue likea child on a recorder--a sound, but not ingovernment.THESEUS  His speech was like a tangled chain--nothingimpaired, but all disordered. Who is next?[Enter Pyramus (Bottom), and Thisbe (Flute), andWall (Snout), and Moonshine (Starveling), and Lion(Snug), and Prologue (Quince).]QUINCE, [as Prologue]Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show.   But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.This man is Pyramus, if you would know.   This beauteous lady Thisbe is certain.This man with lime and roughcast doth present   \"Wall,\" that vile wall which did these lovers   sunder;And through Wall\\'s chink, poor souls, they arecontent   To whisper, at the which let no man wonder.This man, with lantern, dog, and bush of thorn,   Presenteth \"Moonshine,\" for, if you will know,By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn   To meet at Ninus\\' tomb, there, there to woo.This grisly beast (which \"Lion\" hight by name)   The trusty Thisbe coming first by nightDid scare away or rather did affright;And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,   Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,   And finds his trusty Thisbe\\'s mantle slain.Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,   He bravely broached his boiling bloody breast.And Thisbe, tarrying in mulberry shade,   His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twainAt large discourse, while here they do remain.THESEUS  I wonder if the lion be to speak.DEMETRIUS  No wonder, my lord. One lion may whenmany asses do.[Lion, Thisbe, Moonshine, and Prologue exit.]SNOUT, [as Wall]In this same interlude it doth befallThat I, one Snout by name, present a wall;And such a wall as I would have you thinkThat had in it a crannied hole or chink,Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe,Did whisper often, very secretly.This loam, this roughcast, and this stone doth showThat I am that same wall. The truth is so.And this the cranny is, right and sinister,Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.THESEUS  Would you desire lime and hair to speakbetter?DEMETRIUS  It is the wittiest partition that ever I hearddiscourse, my lord.THESEUS  Pyramus draws near the wall. Silence.BOTTOM, [as Pyramus]O grim-looked night! O night with hue so black!   O night, which ever art when day is not!O night! O night! Alack, alack, alack!   I fear my Thisbe\\'s promise is forgot.And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,   That stand\\'st between her father\\'s ground and   mine,Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,   Show me thy chink to blink through with mine   eyne.Thanks, courteous wall. Jove shield thee well forthis.   But what see I? No Thisbe do I see.O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss,   Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!THESEUS  The wall, methinks, being sensible, shouldcurse again.BOTTOM  No, in truth, sir, he should not. \"Deceivingme\" is Thisbe\\'s cue. She is to enter now, and I amto spy her through the wall. You shall see it will fallpat as I told you. Yonder she comes.[Enter Thisbe (Flute).]FLUTE, [as Thisbe]O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans   For parting my fair Pyramus and me.My cherry lips have often kissed thy stones,   Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.BOTTOM, [as Pyramus]I see a voice! Now will I to the chink   To spy an I can hear my Thisbe\\'s face.Thisbe?FLUTE, [as Thisbe]My love! Thou art my love, I think.BOTTOM, [as Pyramus]   Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover\\'s grace,And, like Limander, am I trusty still.FLUTE, [as Thisbe]And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.BOTTOM, [as Pyramus]Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.FLUTE, [as Thisbe]As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.BOTTOM, [as Pyramus]O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall.FLUTE, [as Thisbe]I kiss the wall\\'s hole, not your lips at all.BOTTOM, [as Pyramus]Wilt thou at Ninny\\'s tomb meet me straightway?FLUTE, [as Thisbe]\\'Tide life, \\'tide death, I come without delay.[Bottom and Flute exit.]SNOUT, [as Wall]Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so,And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.\\t[He exits.]THESEUS  Now is the wall down between the twoneighbors.DEMETRIUS  No remedy, my lord, when walls are sowillful to hear without warning.HIPPOLYTA  This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.THESEUS  The best in this kind are but shadows, andthe worst are no worse, if imagination amendthem.HIPPOLYTA  It must be your imagination, then, and nottheirs.THESEUS  If we imagine no worse of them than they ofthemselves, they may pass for excellent men. Herecome two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.[Enter Lion (Snug) and Moonshine (Starveling).]SNUG, [as Lion]You ladies, you whose gentle hearts do fear   The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on   floor,May now perchance both quake and tremble here,   When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.Then know that I, as Snug the joiner, amA lion fell, nor else no lion\\'s dam;For if I should as lion come in strifeInto this place, \\'twere pity on my life.THESEUS  A very gentle beast, and of a goodconscience.DEMETRIUS  The very best at a beast, my lord, that e\\'er Isaw.LYSANDER  This lion is a very fox for his valor.THESEUS  True, and a goose for his discretion.DEMETRIUS  Not so, my lord, for his valor cannot carryhis discretion, and the fox carries the goose.THESEUS  His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry hisvalor, for the goose carries not the fox. It is well.Leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to theMoon.STARVELING, [as Moonshine]This lanthorn doth the horned moon present.DEMETRIUS  He should have worn the horns on hishead.THESEUS  He is no crescent, and his horns are invisiblewithin the circumference.STARVELING, [as Moonshine]This lanthorn doth the horned moon present.Myself the man i\\' th\\' moon do seem to be.THESEUS  This is the greatest error of all the rest; theman should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else\"the man i\\' th\\' moon\"?DEMETRIUS  He dares not come there for the candle,for you see, it is already in snuff.HIPPOLYTA  I am aweary of this moon. Would he wouldchange.THESEUS  It appears by his small light of discretion thathe is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all reason,we must stay the time.LYSANDER  Proceed, Moon.STARVELING, [as Moonshine]   All that I have to say is to tellyou that the lanthorn is the moon, I the man i\\' th\\'moon, this thornbush my thornbush, and this dogmy dog.DEMETRIUS  Why, all these should be in the lanthorn,for all these are in the moon. But silence. Herecomes Thisbe.[Enter Thisbe (Flute).]FLUTE, [as Thisbe]This is old Ninny\\'s tomb. Where is my love?SNUG, [as Lion]  O![The Lion roars. Thisbe runs off,dropping her mantle.]DEMETRIUS  Well roared, Lion.THESEUS  Well run, Thisbe.HIPPOLYTA  Well shone, Moon. Truly, the Moon shineswith a good grace.[Lion worries the mantle.]THESEUS  Well moused, Lion.[Enter Pyramus (Bottom).]DEMETRIUS  And then came Pyramus.[Lion exits.]LYSANDER  And so the lion vanished.BOTTOM, [as Pyramus]Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams.   I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright,For by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,   I trust to take of truest Thisbe sight.--      But stay! O spite!      But mark, poor knight,   What dreadful dole is here!      Eyes, do you see!      How can it be!   O dainty duck! O dear!      Thy mantle good--      What, stained with blood?   Approach, ye Furies fell!      O Fates, come, come,      Cut thread and thrum,   Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!THESEUS  This passion, and the death of a dear friend,would go near to make a man look sad.HIPPOLYTA  Beshrew my heart but I pity the man.BOTTOM, [as Pyramus]O, wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame,   Since lion vile hath here deflowered my dear,Which is--no, no--which was the fairest dame   That lived, that loved, that liked, that looked with   cheer?      Come, tears, confound!      Out, sword, and wound   The pap of Pyramus;      Ay, that left pap,      Where heart doth hop.\\t[Pyramus stabs himself.]   Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.      Now am I dead;      Now am I fled;   My soul is in the sky.      Tongue, lose thy light!      Moon, take thy flight!\\t[Moonshine exits.]   Now die, die, die, die, die.\\t[Pyramus falls.]DEMETRIUS  No die, but an ace for him, for he is butone.LYSANDER  Less than an ace, man, for he is dead, he isnothing.THESEUS  With the help of a surgeon he might yetrecover and yet prove an ass.HIPPOLYTA  How chance Moonshine is gone beforeThisbe comes back and finds her lover?THESEUS  She will find him by starlight.[Enter Thisbe (Flute).]Here she comes, and her passion ends the play.HIPPOLYTA  Methinks she should not use a long one forsuch a Pyramus. I hope she will be brief.DEMETRIUS  A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus,which Thisbe, is the better: he for a man, Godwarrant us; she for a woman, God bless us.LYSANDER  She hath spied him already with thosesweet eyes.DEMETRIUS  And thus she means, videlicet--FLUTE, [as Thisbe]\\t      Asleep, my love?\\t      What, dead, my dove?\\t   O Pyramus, arise!\\t      Speak, speak. Quite dumb?\\t      Dead? Dead? A tomb\\t   Must cover thy sweet eyes.\\t      These lily lips,\\t      This cherry nose,\\t   These yellow cowslip cheeks\\t      Are gone, are gone!\\t      Lovers, make moan;\\t   His eyes were green as leeks.\\t      O Sisters Three,\\t      Come, come to me\\t   With hands as pale as milk.\\t      Lay them in gore,\\t      Since you have shore\\t   With shears his thread of silk.\\t      Tongue, not a word!\\t      Come, trusty sword,\\t   Come, blade, my breast imbrue![Thisbe stabs herself.]\\t      And farewell, friends.\\t      Thus Thisbe ends.\\t   Adieu, adieu, adieu.\\t[Thisbe falls.]THESEUS  Moonshine and Lion are left to bury thedead.DEMETRIUS  Ay, and Wall too.[Bottom and Flute arise.]BOTTOM  No, I assure you, the wall is down thatparted their fathers. Will it please you to see theEpilogue or to hear a Bergomask dance betweentwo of our company?THESEUS  No epilogue, I pray you. For your play needsno excuse. Never excuse. For when the players areall dead, there need none to be blamed. Marry, ifhe that writ it had played Pyramus and hangedhimself in Thisbe\\'s garter, it would have been a finetragedy; and so it is, truly, and very notably discharged.But, come, your Bergomask. Let yourepilogue alone.[Dance, and the players exit.]The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve.Lovers, to bed! \\'Tis almost fairy time.I fear we shall outsleep the coming mornAs much as we this night have overwatched.This palpable-gross play hath well beguiledThe heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.A fortnight hold we this solemnityIn nightly revels and new jollity.\\t[They exit.][Enter Robin Goodfellow.]ROBIN\\tNow the hungry lion roars,\\t   And the wolf behowls the moon,\\tWhilst the heavy plowman snores,\\t   All with weary task fordone.\\tNow the wasted brands do glow,\\t   Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,\\tPuts the wretch that lies in woe\\t   In remembrance of a shroud.\\tNow it is the time of night\\t   That the graves, all gaping wide,\\tEvery one lets forth his sprite\\t   In the church-way paths to glide.\\tAnd we fairies, that do run\\t   By the triple Hecate\\'s team\\tFrom the presence of the sun,\\t   Following darkness like a dream,\\tNow are frolic. Not a mouse\\tShall disturb this hallowed house.\\tI am sent with broom before,\\tTo sweep the dust behind the door.[Enter Oberon and Titania, King and Queen of Fairies,with all their train.]OBERON\\tThrough the house give glimmering light,\\t   By the dead and drowsy fire.\\tEvery elf and fairy sprite,\\t   Hop as light as bird from brier,\\tAnd this ditty after me,\\tSing and dance it trippingly.TITANIA\\tFirst rehearse your song by rote,\\tTo each word a warbling note.\\tHand in hand, with fairy grace,\\tWill we sing and bless this place.[Oberon leads the Fairies in song and dance.]OBERON\\tNow, until the break of day,\\tThrough this house each fairy stray.\\tTo the best bride-bed will we,\\tWhich by us shall blessed be,\\tAnd the issue there create\\tEver shall be fortunate.\\tSo shall all the couples three\\tEver true in loving be,\\tAnd the blots of Nature\\'s hand\\tShall not in their issue stand.\\tNever mole, harelip, nor scar,\\tNor mark prodigious, such as are\\tDespised in nativity,\\tShall upon their children be.\\tWith this field-dew consecrate\\tEvery fairy take his gait,\\tAnd each several chamber bless,\\tThrough this palace, with sweet peace.\\tAnd the owner of it blest,\\tEver shall in safety rest.\\tTrip away. Make no stay.\\tMeet me all by break of day.[All but Robin exit.]ROBIN\\tIf we shadows have offended,\\tThink but this and all is mended:\\tThat you have but slumbered here\\tWhile these visions did appear.\\tAnd this weak and idle theme,\\tNo more yielding but a dream,\\tGentles, do not reprehend.\\tIf you pardon, we will mend.\\tAnd, as I am an honest Puck,\\tIf we have unearned luck\\tNow to \\'scape the serpent\\'s tongue,\\tWe will make amends ere long.\\tElse the Puck a liar call.\\tSo good night unto you all.\\tGive me your hands, if we be friends,\\tAnd Robin shall restore amends.[He exits.]'"
