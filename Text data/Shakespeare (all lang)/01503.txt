<h3>SCENE &nbsp;I. &nbsp;London. &nbsp;A street</h3>
<BR>
<blockquote><i>[Enter GLOSTER.]</i></blockquote>

GLOSTER<BR>
Now is the winter of our discontent<BR>
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;<BR>
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house<BR>
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.<BR>
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;<BR>
Our bruis&egrave;d arms hung up for monuments;<BR>
Our stern alarums chang'd to merry meetings,<BR>
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.<BR>
Grim-visag'd war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;<BR>
And now,&#8212;instead of mounting barb&egrave;d steeds<BR>
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,&#8212;<BR>
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber<BR>
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.<BR>
But I,&#8212;that am not shap'd for sportive tricks,<BR>
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;<BR>
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty<BR>
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;<BR>
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,<BR>
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,<BR>
Deform'd, unfinish'd, sent before my time<BR>
Into this breathing world scarce half made up,<BR>
And that so lamely and unfashionable<BR>
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;&#8212;<BR>
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,<BR>
Have no delight to pass away the time,<BR>
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun,<BR>
And descant on mine own deformity:<BR>
And therefore,&#8212;since I cannot prove a lover,<BR>
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,&#8212;<BR>
I am determin&egrave;d to prove a villain,<BR>
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.<BR>
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,<BR>
By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams,<BR>
To set my brother Clarence and the king<BR>
In deadly hate the one against the other:<BR>
And if King Edward be as true and just<BR>
As I am subtle, false, and treacherous,<BR>
This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,&#8212;<BR>
About a prophecy which says that G<BR>
Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.<BR>
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul:&#8212;here Clarence comes.<BR>
<BR>
<blockquote><i>[Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY.]</i></blockquote>

Brother, good day: what means this arm&egrave;d guard<BR>
That waits upon your grace?<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His majesty,<BR>
Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed<BR>
This conduct to convey me to the Tower.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Upon what cause?<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because my name is George.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;<BR>
He should, for that, commit your godfathers:&#8212;<BR>
O, belike his majesty hath some intent<BR>
That you should be new-christen'd in the Tower.<BR>
But what's the matter, Clarence? may I know?<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest<BR>
As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,<BR>
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;<BR>
And from the cross-row plucks the letter G,<BR>
And says a wizard told him that by G<BR>
His issue disinherited should be;<BR>
And, for my name of George begins with G,<BR>
It follows in his thought that I am he.<BR>
These, as I learn, and such like toys as these,<BR>
Hath mov'd his highness to commit me now.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Why, this it is when men are rul'd by women:&#8212;<BR>
'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower;<BR>
My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she<BR>
That tempers him to this extremity.<BR>
Was it not she and that good man of worship,<BR>
Antony Woodville, her brother there,<BR>
That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,<BR>
From whence this present day he is deliver'd?<BR>
We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
By heaven, I think there is no man is secure<BR>
But the queen's kindred, and night-walking heralds<BR>
That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.<BR>
Heard you not what an humble suppliant<BR>
Lord Hastings was to her for his delivery?<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Humbly complaining to her deity<BR>
Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty.<BR>
I'll tell you what,&#8212;I think it is our way,<BR>
If we will keep in favour with the king,<BR>
To be her men and wear her livery:<BR>
The jealous o'er-worn widow, and herself,<BR>
Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen,<BR>
Are mighty gossips in our monarchy.<BR>
<BR>
BRAKENBURY<BR>
I beseech your graces both to pardon me;<BR>
His majesty hath straitly given in charge<BR>
That no man shall have private conference,<BR>
Of what degree soever, with your brother.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,<BR>
You may partake of any thing we say:<BR>
We speak no treason, man;&#8212;we say the king<BR>
Is wise and virtuous; and his noble queen<BR>
Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;&#8212;<BR>
We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,<BR>
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;<BR>
And that the queen's kindred are made gentlefolks:<BR>
How say you, sir? can you deny all this?<BR>
<BR>
BRAKENBURY<BR>
With this, my lord, myself have naught to do.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Naught to do with Mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,<BR>
He that doth naught with her, excepting one,<BR>
Were best to do it secretly alone.<BR>
<BR>
BRAKENBURY<BR>
What one, my lord?<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Her husband, knave:&#8212;wouldst thou betray me?<BR>
<BR>
BRAKENBURY<BR>
I do beseech your grace to pardon me; and, withal,<BR>
Forbear your conference with the noble duke.<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
We are the queen's abjects and must obey.&#8212;<BR>
Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;<BR>
And whatsoe'er you will employ me in,&#8212;<BR>
Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,&#8212;<BR>
I will perform it to enfranchise you.<BR>
Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood<BR>
Touches me deeper than you can imagine.<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
I know it pleaseth neither of us well.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;<BR>
I will deliver or else lie for you:<BR>
Meantime, have patience.<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must perforce: farewell.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and guard.]</i></blockquote>

GLOSTER<BR>
Go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.<BR>
Simple, plain Clarence!&#8212;I do love thee so<BR>
That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,<BR>
If heaven will take the present at our hands.&#8212;<BR>
But who comes here? The new-delivered Hastings?<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Enter HASTINGS.]</i></blockquote>

HASTINGS<BR>
Good time of day unto my gracious lord!<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain!<BR>
Well are you welcome to the open air.<BR>
How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?<BR>
<BR>
HASTINGS<BR>
With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must;<BR>
But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks<BR>
That were the cause of my imprisonment.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;<BR>
For they that were your enemies are his,<BR>
And have prevail'd as much on him as you.<BR>
<BR>
HASTINGS<BR>
More pity that the eagles should be mew'd<BR>
Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
What news abroad?<BR>
<BR>
HASTINGS<BR>
No news so bad abroad as this at home,&#8212;<BR>
The king is sickly, weak, and melancholy,<BR>
And his physicians fear him mightily.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Now, by Saint Paul, that news is bad indeed.<BR>
O, he hath kept an evil diet long,<BR>
And overmuch consum'd his royal person:<BR>
'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.<BR>
What, is he in his bed?<BR>
<BR>
HASTINGS<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Go you before, and I will follow you.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exit HASTINGS.]</i></blockquote>

He cannot live, I hope; and must not die<BR>
Till George be pack'd with posthorse up to heaven.<BR>
I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence<BR>
With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;<BR>
And, if I fail not in my deep intent,<BR>
Clarence hath not another day to live;<BR>
Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,<BR>
And leave the world for me to bustle in!<BR>
For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter:<BR>
What though I kill'd her husband and her father?<BR>
The readiest way to make the wench amends<BR>
Is to become her husband and her father:<BR>
The which will I; not all so much for love<BR>
As for another secret close intent,<BR>
By marrying her, which I must reach unto.<BR>
But yet I run before my horse to market:<BR>
Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:<BR>
When they are gone, then must I count my gains.<BR>

<BR>
<blockquote><i>[Enter the corpse of King Henry the Sixth, borne in an open coffin, Gentlemen bearing halberds to guard it; and Lady Anne as mourner.]</i></blockquote>

ANNE<BR>
Set down, set down your honourable load,&#8212;<BR>
If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,&#8212;<BR>
Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament<BR>
Th' untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.&#8212;<BR>
Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!<BR>
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!<BR>
Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!<BR>
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,<BR>
To hear the lamentations of poor Anne,<BR>
Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,<BR>
Stabb'd by the self-same hand that made these wounds!<BR>
Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,<BR>
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes:&#8212;<BR>
O, curs&egrave;d be the hand that made these holes!<BR>
Curs&egrave;d the heart that had the heart to do it!<BR>
Curs&egrave;d the blood that let this blood from hence!<BR>
More direful hap betide that hated wretch<BR>
That makes us wretched by the death of thee,<BR>
Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,<BR>
Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!<BR>
If ever he have child, abortive be it,<BR>
Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,<BR>
Whose ugly and unnatural aspect<BR>
May fright the hopeful mother at the view;<BR>
And that be heir to his unhappiness!<BR>
If ever he have wife, let her be made<BR>
More miserable by the death of him<BR>
Than I am made by my young lord and thee!&#8212;<BR>
Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,<BR>
Taken from Paul's to be interr&egrave;d there;<BR>
And still, as you are weary of this weight,<BR>
Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[The Bearers take up the Corpse and advance.]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>[Enter GLOSTER.]</i></blockquote>

GLOSTER<BR>
Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
What black magician conjures up this fiend,<BR>
To stop devoted charitable deeds?<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,<BR>
I'll make a corse of him that disobeys!<BR>
<BR>
FIRST GENTLEMAN<BR>
My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:<BR>
Advance thy halberd higher than my breast,<BR>
Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot<BR>
And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[The Bearers set down the coffin.]</i></blockquote>

ANNE<BR>
What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?<BR>
Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,<BR>
And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.&#8212;<BR>
Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!<BR>
Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,<BR>
His soul thou canst not have; therefore, be gone.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
Foul devil, for God's sake, hence and trouble us not;<BR>
For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,<BR>
Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.<BR>
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,<BR>
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.&#8212;<BR>
O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds<BR>
Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!<BR>
Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity;<BR>
For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood<BR>
From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;<BR>
Thy deeds, inhuman and unnatural,<BR>
Provokes this deluge most unnatural.&#8212;<BR>
O God, which this blood mad'st, revenge his death!<BR>
O earth, which this blood drink'st, revenge his death!<BR>
Either, heaven, with lightning strike the murderer dead;<BR>
Or, earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,<BR>
As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood,<BR>
Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Lady, you know no rules of charity,<BR>
Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
Villain, thou knowest nor law of God nor man:<BR>
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
But I know none, and therefore am no beast.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
More wonderful when angels are so angry.&#8212;<BR>
Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,<BR>
Of these suppos&egrave;d crimes to give me leave,<BR>
By circumstance, but to acquit myself.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
Vouchsafe, diffus'd infection of a man,<BR>
Of these known evils but to give me leave,<BR>
By circumstance, to accuse thy curs&egrave;d self.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have<BR>
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make<BR>
No excuse current but to hang thyself.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
By such despair I should accuse myself.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
And by despairing shalt thou stand excus'd;<BR>
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,<BR>
That didst unworthy slaughter upon others.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Say that I slew them not?<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then say they were not slain:<BR>
But dead they are, and, devilish slave, by thee.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
I did not kill your husband.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, then he is alive.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw<BR>
Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;<BR>
The which thou once didst bend against her breast,<BR>
But that thy brothers beat aside the point.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
I was provok&egrave;d by her slanderous tongue<BR>
That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
Thou wast provok&egrave;d by thy bloody mind,<BR>
That never dreamt on aught but butcheries:<BR>
Didst thou not kill this king?<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I grant ye.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too<BR>
Thou mayst be damn&egrave;d for that wicked deed!<BR>
O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
The better for the king of Heaven, that hath him.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Let him thank me that holp to send him thither,<BR>
For he was fitter for that place than earth.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
And thou unfit for any place but hell.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
Some dungeon.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your bed-chamber.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
So will it, madam, till I lie with you.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
I hope so.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know so.&#8212;But, gentle Lady Anne,&#8212;<BR>
To leave this keen encounter of our wits,<BR>
And fall something into a slower method,&#8212;<BR>
Is not the causer of the timeless deaths<BR>
Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,<BR>
As blameful as the executioner?<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
Thou wast the cause and most accurs'd effect.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Your beauty was the cause of that effect;<BR>
Your beauty, that did haunt me in my sleep<BR>
To undertake the death of all the world,<BR>
So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,<BR>
These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
These eyes could not endure that beauty's wreck;<BR>
You should not blemish it if I stood by:<BR>
As all the world is cheer&egrave;d by the sun,<BR>
So I by that; it is my day, my life.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Curse not thyself, fair creature; thou art both.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
I would I were, to be reveng'd on thee.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
It is a quarrel most unnatural,<BR>
To be reveng'd on him that loveth thee.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
It is a quarrel just and reasonable,<BR>
To be reveng'd on him that kill'd my husband.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,<BR>
Did it to help thee to a better husband.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
His better doth not breathe upon the earth.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
He lives that loves thee better than he could.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
Name him.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plantagenet.<BR>

<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
The self-same name, but one of better nature.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
Where is he?<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why dost thou spit at me?<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Never came poison from so sweet a place.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
Never hung poison on a fouler toad.<BR>
Out of my sight! thou dost infect mine eyes.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead!<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
I would they were, that I might die at once;<BR>
For now they kill me with a living death.<BR>
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,<BR>
Sham'd their aspects with store of childish drops:<BR>
These eyes, which never shed remorseful tear,<BR>
No, when my father York and Edward wept,<BR>
To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made<BR>
When black-fac'd Clifford shook his sword at him;<BR>
Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,<BR>
Told the sad story of my father's death,<BR>
And twenty times made pause, to sob and weep,<BR>
That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks,<BR>
Like trees bedash'd with rain; in that sad time<BR>
My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;<BR>
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,<BR>
Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.<BR>
I never su'd to friend nor enemy;<BR>
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;<BR>
But, now thy beauty is propos'd my fee,<BR>
My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[She looks scornfully at him.]</i></blockquote>

Teach not thy lip such scorn; for it was made<BR>
For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.<BR>
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,<BR>
Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;<BR>
Which if thou please to hide in this true breast<BR>
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,<BR>
I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,<BR>
And humbly beg the death upon my knee,<BR>
Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,&#8212;<BR>

<blockquote><i>[He lays his breast open; she offers at it with his sword.]</i></blockquote>

But 'twas thy beauty that provok&egrave;d me.<BR>
Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,&#8212;<BR>

<blockquote><i>[She again offers at his breast.]</i></blockquote>

But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[She lets fall the sword.]</i></blockquote>

Take up the sword again, or take up me.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,<BR>
I will not be thy executioner.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
I have already.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was in thy rage:<BR>
Speak it again, and even with the word,<BR>
This hand, which for thy love did kill thy love;<BR>
Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;<BR>
To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
I would I knew thy heart.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
'Tis figured in my tongue.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
I fear me both are false.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Then never was man true.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
Well, well, put up your sword.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Say, then, my peace is made.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
That shalt thou know hereafter.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
But shall I live in hope?<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
All men, I hope, live so.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Vouchsafe to wear this ring.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
To take is not to give.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[She puts on the ring.]</i></blockquote>

GLOSTER<BR>
Look, how this ring encompasseth thy finger,<BR>
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;<BR>
Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.<BR>
And if thy poor devoted servant may<BR>
But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,<BR>
Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
What is it?<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
That it may please you leave these sad designs<BR>
To him that hath most cause to be a mourner,<BR>
And presently repair to Crosby Place;<BR>
Where,&#8212;after I have solemnly interr'd<BR>
At Chertsey monastery, this noble king,<BR>
And wet his grave with my repentant tears,&#8212;<BR>
I will with all expedient duty see you:<BR>
For divers unknown reasons, I beseech you,<BR>
Grant me this boon.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
With all my heart; and much it joys me too<BR>
To see you are become so penitent.&#8212;<BR>
Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Bid me farewell.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis more than you deserve;<BR>
But since you teach me how to flatter you,<BR>
Imagine I have said farewell already.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exeunt Lady Anne, Tress, and Berk.]</i></blockquote>

GLOSTER<BR>
Sirs, take up the corse.<BR>
<BR>
GENTLEMEN<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards Chertsey, noble lord?<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
No, to White Friars; there attend my coming.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exeunt the rest, with the Corpse.]</i></blockquote>

Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?<BR>
Was ever woman in this humour won?<BR>
I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.<BR>
What! I that kill'd her husband and his father,<BR>
To take her in her heart's extremest hate;<BR>
With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,<BR>
The bleeding witness of her hatred by;<BR>
Having God, her conscience, and these bars against me,<BR>
And I no friends to back my suit withal,<BR>
But the plain devil and dissembling looks,<BR>
And yet to win her,&#8212;all the world to nothing!<BR>
Ha!<BR>
Hath she forgot already that brave prince,<BR>
Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,<BR>
Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?<BR>
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,&#8212;<BR>
Fram'd in the prodigality of nature,<BR>
Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,&#8212;<BR>
The spacious world cannot again afford:<BR>
And will she yet abase her eyes on me,<BR>
That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,<BR>
And made her widow to a woeful bed?<BR>
On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?<BR>
On me, that halt and am misshapen thus?<BR>
My dukedom to a beggarly denier,<BR>
I do mistake my person all this while:<BR>
Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,<BR>
Myself to be a marvellous proper man.<BR>
I'll be at charges for a looking-glass;<BR>
And entertain a score or two of tailors,<BR>
To study fashions to adorn my body:<BR>
Since I am crept in favour with myself,<BR>
I will maintain it with some little cost.<BR>
But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;<BR>
And then return lamenting to my love.&#8212;<BR>
Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,<BR>
That I may see my shadow as I pass.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, LORD RIVERS, and LORD GREY.]</i></blockquote>

RIVERS<BR>
Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty<BR>
Will soon recover his accustom'd health.<BR>
<BR>
GREY.<BR>
In that you brook it ill, it makes him worse:<BR>
Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,<BR>
And cheer his grace with quick and merry eyes.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
If he were dead, what would betide on me?<BR>
<BR>
GREY<BR>
No other harm but loss of such a lord.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
The loss of such a lord includes all harms.<BR>
<BR>
GREY<BR>
The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son<BR>
To be your comforter when he is gone.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Ah, he is young; and his minority<BR>
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloster,<BR>
A man that loves not me, nor none of you.<BR>
<BR>
RIVERS<BR>
Is it concluded he shall be protector?<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
It is determin'd, not concluded yet:<BR>
But so it must be, if the king miscarry.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Enter BUCKINGHAM and STANLEY.]</i></blockquote>

GREY<BR>
Here come the Lords of Buckingham and Stanley.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Good time of day unto your royal grace!<BR>
<BR>
STANLEY<BR>
God make your majesty joyful as you have been!<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Stanley,<BR>
To your good prayer will scarcely say amen.<BR>
Yet, Stanley, notwithstanding she's your wife,<BR>
And loves not me, be you, good lord, assur'd<BR>
I hate not you for her proud arrogance.<BR>
<BR>
STANLEY<BR>
I do beseech you, either not believe<BR>
The envious slanders of her false accusers;<BR>
Or, if she be accus'd on true report,<BR>
Bear with her weakness, which I think proceeds<BR>
From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Stanley?<BR>
<BR>
STANLEY<BR>
But now the Duke of Buckingham and I<BR>
Are come from visiting his majesty.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
What likelihood of his amendment, lords?<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
God grant him health! Did you confer with him?<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Ay, madam; he desires to make atonement<BR>
Between the Duke of Gloster and your brothers,<BR>
And between them and my lord chamberlain;<BR>
And sent to warn them to his royal presence.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Would all were well!&#8212;but that will never be:<BR>
I fear our happiness is at the height.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Enter GLOSTER, HASTINGS, and DORSET.]</i></blockquote>

GLOSTER<BR>
They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:&#8212;<BR>
Who are they that complain unto the king<BR>
That I, forsooth, am stern and love them not?<BR>
By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly<BR>
That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.<BR>
Because I cannot flatter and look fair,<BR>
Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive, and cog,<BR>
Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,<BR>
I must be held a rancorous enemy.<BR>
Cannot a plain man live, and think no harm,<BR>
But thus his simple truth must be abus'd<BR>
With silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?<BR>
<BR>
GREY<BR>
To who in all this presence speaks your grace?<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.<BR>
When have I injur'd thee? when done thee wrong?&#8212;<BR>
Or thee?&#8212;or thee?&#8212;or any of your faction?<BR>
A plague upon you all! His royal grace,&#8212;<BR>
Whom God preserve better than you would wish!&#8212;<BR>
Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing while,<BR>
But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Brother of Gloster, you mistake the matter.<BR>
The king, on his own royal disposition,<BR>
And not provok'd by any suitor else&#8212;<BR>
Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred<BR>
That in your outward action shows itself<BR>
Against my children, brothers, and myself&#8212;<BR>
Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather<BR>
The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad<BR>
That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:<BR>
Since every Jack became a gentleman,<BR>
There's many a gentle person made a Jack.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Come, come, we know your meaning, brother Gloster;<BR>
You envy my advancement, and my friends';<BR>
God grant we never may have need of you!<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:<BR>
Our brother is imprison'd by your means,<BR>
Myself disgrac'd, and the nobility<BR>
Held in contempt; while great promotions<BR>
Are daily given to ennoble those<BR>
That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
By Him that rais'd me to this careful height<BR>
From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,<BR>
I never did incense his majesty<BR>
Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been<BR>
An earnest advocate to plead for him.<BR>
My lord, you do me shameful injury<BR>
Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
You may deny that you were not the mean<BR>
Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.<BR>
<BR>
RIVERS<BR>
She may, my lord; for,&#8212;<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
She may, Lord Rivers?&#8212;why, who knows not so?<BR>
She may do more, sir, than denying that:<BR>
She may help you to many fair preferments;<BR>
And then deny her aiding hand therein,<BR>
And lay those honours on your high desert.<BR>
What may she not? She may,&#8212;ay, marry, may she,&#8212;<BR>
<BR>
RIVERS<BR>
What, marry, may she?<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER.<BR>
What, marry, may she! marry with a king,<BR>
A bachelor, and a handsome stripling too:<BR>
I wis your grandam had a worser match.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
My Lord of Gloster, I have too long borne<BR>
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:<BR>
By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty<BR>
Of those gross taunts that oft I have endur'd.<BR>
I had rather be a country servant-maid<BR>
Than a great queen with this condition,&#8212;<BR>
To be so baited, scorn'd, and stormed at.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Enter old QUEEN MARGARET, behind.]</i></blockquote>

Small joy have I in being England's queen.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN MARGARET<BR>
And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech Him!<BR>
Thy honour, state, and seat, is due to me.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
What! Threat you me with telling of the king?<BR>
Tell him, and spare not: look what I have said<BR>
I will avouch in presence of the king:<BR>
I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.<BR>
'Tis time to speak,&#8212;my pains are quite forgot.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN MARGARET<BR>
Out, devil! I do remember them too well:<BR>
Thou kill'dst my husband Henry in the Tower,<BR>
And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Ere you were queen, ay, or your husband king,<BR>
I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;<BR>
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,<BR>
A liberal rewarder of his friends;<BR>
To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN MARGARET<BR>
Ay, and much better blood than his or thine.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
In all which time you and your husband Grey<BR>
Were factious for the house of Lancaster;&#8212;<BR>
And, Rivers, so were you: was not your husband<BR>
In Margaret's battle at Saint Albans slain?<BR>
Let me put in your minds, if you forget,<BR>
What you have been ere this, and what you are;<BR>
Withal, what I have been, and what I am.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN MARGARET<BR>
A murderous villain, and so still thou art.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;<BR>
Ay, and forswore himself,&#8212;which Jesu pardon!&#8212;<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN MARGARET<BR>
Which God revenge!<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
To fight on Edward's party for the crown;<BR>
And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.<BR>
I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's,<BR>
Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine:<BR>
I am too childish-foolish for this world.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN MARGARET<BR>
Hie thee to hell for shame and leave this world,<BR>
Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.<BR>
<BR>
RIVERS<BR>
My Lord of Gloster, in those busy days<BR>
Which here you urge to prove us enemies,<BR>
We follow'd then our lord, our sovereign king:<BR>
So should we you, if you should be our king.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
If I should be!&#8212;I had rather be a pedler:<BR>
Far be it from my heart, the thought thereof!<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
As little joy, my lord, as you suppose<BR>
You should enjoy, were you this country's king,&#8212;<BR>
As little joy you may suppose in me,<BR>
That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN MARGARET<BR>
As little joy enjoys the queen thereof;<BR>
For I am she, and altogether joyless.<BR>
I can no longer hold me patient.&#8212;<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Advancing.]</i></blockquote>

Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out<BR>
In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!<BR>
Which of you trembles not that looks on me?<BR>
If not that, I am queen, you bow like subjects,<BR>
Yet that, by you depos'd, you quake like rebels?<BR>
Ah, gentle villain, do not turn away!<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Foul wrinkled witch, what mak'st thou in my sight?<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN MARGARET<BR>
But repetition of what thou hast marr'd,<BR>
That will I make before I let thee go.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Wert thou not banish&egrave;d on pain of death?<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN MARGARET<BR>
I was; but I do find more pain in banishment<BR>
Than death can yield me here by my abode.<BR>
A husband and a son thou ow'st to me,&#8212;<BR>
And thou a kingdom,&#8212;all of you allegiance:<BR>
This sorrow that I have, by right is yours;<BR>
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
The curse my noble father laid on thee,<BR>
When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper,<BR>
And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes;<BR>
And then to dry them gav'st the Duke a clout<BR>
Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland;&#8212;<BR>
His curses, then from bitterness of soul<BR>
Denounc'd against thee, are all fallen upon thee;<BR>
And God, not we, hath plagu'd thy bloody deed.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
So just is God, to right the innocent.<BR>
<BR>
HASTINGS<BR>
O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,<BR>
And the most merciless that e'er was heard of.<BR>
<BR>
RIVERS<BR>
Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.<BR>
<BR>
DORSET<BR>
No man but prophesied revenge for it.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN MARGARET<BR>
What, were you snarling all before I came,<BR>
Ready to catch each other by the throat,<BR>
And turn you all your hatred now on me?<BR>
Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven<BR>
That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,<BR>
Their kingdom's loss, my woeful banishment,<BR>
Should all but answer for that peevish brat?<BR>
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?&#8212;<BR>
Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!&#8212;<BR>
Though not by war, by surfeit die your king,<BR>
As ours by murder, to make him a king!<BR>
Edward thy son, that now is Prince of Wales,<BR>
For Edward our son, that was Prince of Wales,<BR>
Die in his youth by like untimely violence!<BR>
Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,<BR>
Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!<BR>
Long mayest thou live to wail thy children's death;<BR>
And see another, as I see thee now,<BR>
Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!<BR>
Long die thy happy days before thy death;<BR>
And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,<BR>
Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!&#8212;<BR>
Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,&#8212;<BR>
And so wast thou, Lord Hastings,&#8212;when my son<BR>
Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray Him,<BR>
That none of you may live his natural age,<BR>
But by some unlook'd accident cut off!<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN MARGARET<BR>
And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.<BR>
If heaven have any grievous plague in store<BR>
Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,<BR>
O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,<BR>
And then hurl down their indignation<BR>
On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!<BR>
The worm of conscience still be-gnaw thy soul!<BR>
Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou liv'st,<BR>
And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!<BR>
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,<BR>
Unless it be while some tormenting dream<BR>
Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!<BR>
Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!<BR>
Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity<BR>
The slave of nature and the son of hell!<BR>
Thou slander of thy heavy mother's womb!<BR>
Thou loath&egrave;d issue of thy father's loins!<BR>
Thou rag of honour! thou detested&#8212;<BR>

Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply.<BR>
O, let me make the period to my curse!<BR>

Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?<BR>
Fool, fool! thou whett'st a knife to kill thyself.<BR>

False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,<BR>

To serve me well, you all should do me duty,<BR>
Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:<BR>
O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!<BR>
<BR>
DORSET<BR>
Dispute not with her,&#8212;she is lunatic.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN MARGARET<BR>
Peace, master marquis, you are malapert:<BR>
Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current:<BR>
O, that your young nobility could judge<BR>
What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!<BR>
They that stand high have many blasts to shake them;<BR>
And if they fall they dash themselves to pieces.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Good counsel, marry:&#8212;learn it, learn it, marquis.<BR>
<BR>
DORSET<BR>
It touches you, my lord, as much as me.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Ay, and much more: but I was born so high,<BR>
Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,<BR>
And dallies with the wind, and scorns the sun.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN MARGARET<BR>
And turns the sun to shade;&#8212;alas! alas!&#8212;<BR>
Witness my son, now in the shade of death;<BR>
Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath,<BR>
Hath in eternal darkness folded up.<BR>
Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest:&#8212;<BR>
O God that seest it, do not suffer it;<BR>
As it is won with blood, lost be it so!<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Peace, peace, for shame, if not for charity.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN MARGARET<BR>
Urge neither charity nor shame to me:<BR>
Uncharitably with me have you dealt,<BR>
And shamefully my hopes by you are butcher'd.<BR>
My charity is outrage, life my shame,&#8212;<BR>
And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage!<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Have done, have done.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN MARGARET<BR>
O princely Buckingham, I'll kiss thy hand,<BR>
In sign of league and amity with thee:<BR>
Now fair befall thee and thy noble house!<BR>
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,<BR>
Nor thou within the compass of my curse.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Nor no one here; for curses never pass<BR>
The lips of those that breathe them in the air.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN MARGARET<BR>
I will not think but they ascend the sky,<BR>
And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.<BR>
O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!<BR>
Look, when he fawns he bites; and when he bites,<BR>
His venom tooth will rankle to the death:<BR>
Have not to do with him, beware of him;<BR>
Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,<BR>
And all their ministers attend on him.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN MARGARET<BR>
What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?<BR>
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?<BR>
O, but remember this another day,<BR>
When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,<BR>
And say, poor Margaret was a prophetess!&#8212;<BR>
Live each of you the subjects to his hate,<BR>
And he to yours, and all of you to God's!<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exit.]</i></blockquote>

BUCKINGHAM<BR>
My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses.<BR>
<BR>
RIVERS<BR>
And so doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,<BR>
She hath had too much wrong; and I repent<BR>
My part thereof that I have done to her.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
I never did her any, to my knowledge.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong.<BR>
I was too hot to do somebody good,<BR>
That is too cold in thinking of it now.<BR>
Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid;<BR>
He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains;<BR>
God pardon them that are the cause thereof!<BR>
<BR>
RIVERS<BR>
A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,<BR>
To pray for them that have done scathe to us!<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
So do I ever being well advis'd;<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Aside]</i></blockquote>

For had I curs'd now, I had curs'd myself.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Enter CATESBY.]</i></blockquote>

CATESBY<BR>
Madam, his majesty doth can for you,&#8212;<BR>
And for your grace,&#8212;and you, my noble lords.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Catesby, I come.&#8212;Lords, will you go with me?<BR>
<BR>
RIVERS<BR>
We wait upon your grace.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exeunt all but GLOSTER.]</i></blockquote>

GLOSTER<BR>
I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.<BR>
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach<BR>
I lay unto the grievous charge of others.<BR>
Clarence,&#8212;whom I indeed have cast in darkness,&#8212;<BR>
I do beweep to many simple gulls;<BR>
Namely, to Stanley, Hastings, Buckingham;<BR>
And tell them 'tis the queen and her allies<BR>
That stir the king against the duke my brother.<BR>
Now they believe it; and withal whet me<BR>
To be reveng'd on Rivers, Vaughn, Grey:<BR>
But then I sigh; and, with a piece of Scripture,<BR>
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:<BR>
And thus I clothe my naked villany<BR>
With odd old ends stol'n forth of holy writ;<BR>
And seem a saint when most I play the devil.&#8212;<BR>
But, soft, here come my executioners.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Enter two MURDERERS.]</i></blockquote>

How now, my hardy stout resolv&egrave;d mates!<BR>
Are you now going to dispatch this thing?<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
We are, my lord, and come to have the warrant,<BR>
That we may be admitted where he is.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Well thought upon;&#8212;I have it here about me:<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Gives the warrant.]</i></blockquote>

When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.<BR>
But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,<BR>
Withal obd&uacute;rate, do not hear him plead;<BR>
For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps<BR>
May move your hearts to pity, if you mark him.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
Tut, tut, my lord, we will not stand to prate;<BR>
Talkers are no good doers: be assur'd<BR>
We go to use our hands, and not our tongues.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Your eyes drop millstones when fools' eyes fall tears:<BR>
I like you, lads;&#8212;about your business straight;<BR>
Go, go, despatch.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
We will, my noble lord.<BR>

<h3><a name="A1S4"><BR>SCENE &nbsp;IV. &nbsp;London. &nbsp;A Room in the Tower</a></h3>
<BR>
<blockquote><i>[Enter CLARENCE and BRAKENBURY.]</i></blockquote>

BRAKENBURY<BR>
Why looks your grace so heavily to-day?<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
O, I have pass'd a miserable night,<BR>
So full of fearful dreams, of ugly sights,<BR>
That, as I am a Christian faithful man,<BR>
I would not spend another such a night<BR>
Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,&#8212;<BR>
So full of dismal terror was the time!<BR>
<BR>
BRAKENBURY<BR>
What was your dream, my lord? I pray you tell me.<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,<BR>
And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;<BR>
And, in my company, my brother Gloster;<BR>
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk<BR>
Upon the hatches: thence we look'd toward England,<BR>
And cited up a thousand heavy times,<BR>
During the wars of York and Lancaster,<BR>
That had befall'n us. As we pac'd along<BR>
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,<BR>
Methought that Gloster stumbled; and, in falling,<BR>
Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard<BR>
Into the tumbling billows of the main.<BR>
O Lord, methought what pain it was to drown!<BR>
What dreadful noise of waters in my ears!<BR>
What sights of ugly death within my eyes!<BR>
Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;<BR>
A thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;<BR>
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,<BR>
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,<BR>
All scatt'red in the bottom of the sea:<BR>
Some lay in dead men's skulls; and in the holes<BR>
Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept,&#8212;<BR>
As 'twere in scorn of eyes,&#8212;reflecting gems,<BR>
That woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,<BR>
And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.<BR>
<BR>
BRAKENBURY<BR>
Had you such leisure in the time of death<BR>
To gaze upon these secrets of the deep?<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
Methought I had; and often did I strive<BR>
To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood<BR>
Stopp'd in my soul, and would not let it forth<BR>
To find the empty, vast, and wandering air;<BR>
But smother'd it within my panting bulk,<BR>
Who almost burst to belch it in the sea.<BR>
<BR>
BRAKENBURY<BR>
Awak'd you not in this sore agony?<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
No, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;<BR>
O, then began the tempest to my soul!<BR>
I pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood<BR>
With that grim ferryman which poets write of,<BR>
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.<BR>
The first that there did greet my stranger soul<BR>
Was my great father-in-law, renown&egrave;d Warwick;<BR>
Who spake aloud, "What scourge for perjury<BR>
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?"<BR>
And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by<BR>
A shadow like an Angel, with bright hair<BR>
Dabbled in blood; and he shriek'd out aloud<BR>
"Clarence is come,&#8212;false, fleeting, perjur'd Clarence,&#8212;<BR>
That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;&#8212;<BR>
Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!"<BR>
With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends<BR>
Environ'd me, and howl&egrave;d in mine ears<BR>
Such hideous cries that, with the very noise,<BR>
I trembling wak'd, and for a season after<BR>
Could not believe but that I was in hell,&#8212;<BR>
Such terrible impression made my dream.<BR>
<BR>
BRAKENBURY<BR>
No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you;<BR>
I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
Ah, Brakenbury, I have done these things<BR>
That now give evidence against my soul,<BR>
For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!&#8212;<BR>
O God! If my deep prayers cannot appease Thee,<BR>
But Thou wilt be aveng'd on my misdeeds,<BR>
Yet execute Thy wrath in me alone,&#8212;<BR>
O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!&#8212;<BR>
Keeper, I prithee sit by me awhile;<BR>
My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.<BR>
<BR>
BRAKENBURY<BR>
I will, my lord; God give your grace good rest!&#8212;<BR>

<blockquote><i>[CLARENCE reposes himself on a chair.]</i></blockquote>

Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,<BR>
Makes the night morning and the noontide night.<BR>
Princes have but their titles for their glories,<BR>
An outward honour for an inward toil;<BR>
And, for unfelt imaginations,<BR>
They often feel a world of restless cares:<BR>
So that, between their tides and low name,<BR>
There's nothing differs but the outward fame.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Enter the two MURDERERS.]</i></blockquote>

FIRST MURDERER<BR>
Ho! who's here?<BR>
<BR>
BRAKENBURY<BR>
What wouldst thou, fellow, and how cam'st thou hither?<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.<BR>
<BR>
BRAKENBURY<BR>
What, so brief?<BR>
<BR>
SECOND MURDERER<BR>
'Tis better, sir, than to be tedious.&#8212;Let him see our commission and talk no more.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[A paper is delivered to BRAKENBURY, who reads it.]</i></blockquote>

BRAKENBURY<BR>
I am, in this, commanded to deliver<BR>
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:&#8212;<BR>
I will not reason what is meant hereby,<BR>
Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.<BR>
There lies the Duke asleep,&#8212;and there the keys;<BR>
I'll to the king and signify to him<BR>
That thus I have resign'd to you my charge.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
You may, sir; 'tis a point of wisdom: fare you well.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exit BRAKENBURY.]</i></blockquote>

SECOND MURDERER<BR>
What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
No; he'll say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.<BR>
<BR>
SECOND MURDERER<BR>
When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake until the great judgment-day.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
Why, then he'll say we stabb'd him sleeping.<BR>
<BR>
SECOND MURDERER<BR>
The urging of that word "judgment" hath bred a kind of remorse in me.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
What, art thou afraid?<BR>
<BR>
SECOND MURDERER<BR>
Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be damned for killing him, from the which no warrant can defend me.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
I thought thou hadst been resolute.<BR>
<BR>
SECOND MURDERER<BR>
So I am, to let him live.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
I'll back to the Duke of Gloster and tell him so.<BR>
<BR>
SECOND MURDERER<BR>
Nay, I pr'ythee, stay a little: I hope my holy humour will change; it was wont to hold me but while one tells twenty.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
How dost thou feel thyself now?<BR>
<BR>
SECOND MURDERER<BR>
Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
Remember our reward, when the deed's done.<BR>
<BR>
SECOND MURDERER<BR>
Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
Where's thy conscience now?<BR>
<BR>
SECOND MURDERER<BR>
O, in the Duke of Gloster's purse.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
So, when he opens his purse to give us our reward, thy conscience flies out.<BR>
<BR>
SECOND MURDERER<BR>
'Tis no matter; let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
What if it come to thee again?<BR>
<BR>
SECOND MURDERER<BR>
I'll not meddle with it,&#8212;it makes a man coward; a man cannot steal, but it accuseth him; a man cannot swear, but it checks him; a man cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it detects him: 'tis a blushing shame-faced spirit that mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills a man full of obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold that by chance I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it is turned out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing; and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust to himself and live without it.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
Zounds,'tis even now at my elbow, persuading me not to kill the duke.<BR>
<BR>
SECOND MURDERER<BR>
Take the devil in thy mind, and believe him not; he would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
I am strong-framed; he cannot prevail with me.<BR>
<BR>
SECOND MURDERER<BR>
Spoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation. Come, shall we fall to work?<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
Take him on the costard with the hilts of thy sword, and then throw him in the malmsey-butt in the next room.<BR>
<BR>
SECOND MURDERER<BR>
O excellent device! and make a sop of him.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
Soft! he wakes.<BR>
<BR>
SECOND MURDERER<BR>
Strike!<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
No, we'll reason with him.<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.<BR>
<BR>
SECOND MURDERER<BR>
You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
In God's name, what art thou?<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
A man, as you are.<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
But not as I am, royal.<BR>
<BR>
SECOND MURDERER<BR>
Nor you as we are, loyal.<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own.<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!<BR>
Your eyes do menace me; why look you pale?<BR>
Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?<BR>
<BR>
SECOND MURDERER<BR>
To, to, to&#8212;<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
To murder me?<BR>
<BR>
BOTH MURDERERS<BR>
Ay, ay.<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,<BR>
And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.<BR>
Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
Offended us you have not, but the king.<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
I shall be reconcil'd to him again.<BR>
<BR>
SECOND MURDERER<BR>
Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
Are you drawn forth among a world of men<BR>
To slay the innocent? What is my offence?<BR>
Where is the evidence that doth accuse me?<BR>
What lawful quest have given their verdict up<BR>
Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounc'd<BR>
The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?<BR>
Before I be conv&iacute;ct by course of law,<BR>
To threaten me with death is most unlawful.<BR>
I charge you, as you hope to have redemption<BR>
By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,<BR>
That you depart, and lay no hands on me:<BR>
The deed you undertake is damnable.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
What we will do, we do upon command.<BR>
<BR>
SECOND MURDERER<BR>
And he that hath commanded is our king.<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
Erroneous vassals! the great King of kings<BR>
Hath in the table of his law commanded<BR>
That thou shalt do no murder: will you then<BR>
Spurn at His edict and fulfil a man's?<BR>
Take heed; for He holds vengeance in His hand<BR>
To hurl upon their heads that break His law.<BR>
<BR>
SECOND MURDERER<BR>
And that same vengeance doth He hurl on thee<BR>
For false forswearing, and for murder too:<BR>
Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight<BR>
In quarrel of the house of Lancaster.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
And like a traitor to the name of God<BR>
Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade<BR>
Unripp'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.<BR>
<BR>
SECOND MURDERER<BR>
Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and defend.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,<BR>
When thou hast broke it in such dear degree?<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?<BR>
For Edward, for my brother, for his sake:<BR>
He sends you not to murder me for this;<BR>
For in that sin he is as deep as I.<BR>
If God will be aveng&egrave;d for the deed,<BR>
O, know you yet He doth it publicly.<BR>
Take not the quarrel from His powerful arm;<BR>
He needs no indirect or lawless course<BR>
To cut off those that have offended Him.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
Who made thee, then, a bloody minister<BR>
When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,<BR>
That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy faults,<BR>
Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
If you do love my brother, hate not me;<BR>
I am his brother, and I love him well.<BR>
If you are hir'd for meed, go back again,<BR>
And I will send you to my brother Gloster,<BR>
Who shall reward you better for my life<BR>
Than Edward will for tidings of my death.<BR>
<BR>
SECOND MURDERER<BR>
You are deceiv'd, your brother Gloster hates you.<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:<BR>
Go you to him from me.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ay, so we will.<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
Tell him when that our princely father York<BR>
Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm<BR>
And charg'd us from his soul to love each other,<BR>
He little thought of this divided friendship:<BR>
Bid Gloster think of this, and he will weep.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
Ay, millstones; as he lesson'd us to weep.<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
O, do not slander him, for he is kind.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
Right, as snow in harvest.&#8212;Come, you deceive yourself:<BR>
'Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
It cannot be; for he bewept my fortune,<BR>
And hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,<BR>
That he would labour my delivery.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
Why, so he doth, when he delivers you<BR>
From this earth's thraldom to the joys of heaven.<BR>
<BR>
SECOND MURDERER<BR>
Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
Have you that holy feeling in your souls,<BR>
To counsel me to make my peace with God,<BR>
And are you yet to your own souls so blind<BR>
That you will war with God by murdering me?&#8212;<BR>
O, sirs, consider, they that set you on<BR>
To do this deed will hate you for the deed.<BR>
<BR>
SECOND MURDERER<BR>
What shall we do?<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relent, and save your souls.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER<BR>
Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.<BR>
<BR>
CLARENCE<BR>
Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.<BR>
Which of you, if you were a prince's son,<BR>
Being pent from liberty, as I am now,&#8212;<BR>
If two such murderers as yourselves came to you,&#8212;<BR>
Would not entreat for life?&#8212;<BR>
My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks;<BR>
O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,<BR>
Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,<BR>
As you would beg, were you in my distress:<BR>
A begging prince what beggar pities not?<BR>
<BR>
SECOND MURDERER<BR>
Look behind you, my lord.<BR>
<BR>
FIRST MURDERER.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Stabs him.]</i></blockquote>

Take that, and that: if all this will not do,<BR>
I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exit with the body.]</i></blockquote>

SECOND MURDERER<BR>
A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd!<BR>
How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands<BR>
Of this most grievous murder!<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Re-enter FIRST MURDERER.]</i></blockquote>

FIRST MURDERER<BR>
How now, what mean'st thou that thou help'st me not?<BR>
By heavens, the duke shall know how slack you have been!<BR>
<BR>
SECOND MURDERER<BR>
I would he knew that I had sav'd his brother!<BR>
Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;<BR>
For I repent me that the duke is slain.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exit.]</i></blockquote>

FIRST MURDERER<BR>
So do not I: go, coward as thou art.&#8212;<BR>
Well, I'll go hide the body in some hole,<BR>
Till that the duke give order for his burial:<BR>
And when I have my meed, I will away;<BR>
For this will out, and then I must not stay.<BR>

And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!<BR>
<BR>
KING EDWARD<BR>
Madam, yourself is not exempt from this;&#8212;<BR>
Nor you, son Dorset;&#8212;Buckingham, nor you;&#8212;<BR>
You have been factious one against the other.<BR>
Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;<BR>
And what you do, do it unfeignedly.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
There, Hastings; I will never more remember<BR>
Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!<BR>
<BR>
KING EDWARD<BR>
Dorset, embrace him;&#8212;Hastings, love lord marquis.<BR>
<BR>
DORSET<BR>
This interchange of love, I here protest,<BR>
Upon my part shall be inviolable.<BR>
<BR>
HASTINGS<BR>
And so swear I.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Embraces Dorset.]</i></blockquote>

KING EDWARD<BR>
Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league<BR>
With thy embracements to my wife's allies,<BR>
And make me happy in your unity.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate<BR>
Upon your grace <i>[to the queen]</i>, but with all duteous love<BR>
Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me<BR>
With hate in those where I expect most love!<BR>
When I have most need to employ a friend,<BR>
And most assur&egrave;d that he is a friend,<BR>
Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,<BR>
Be he unto me!&#8212;this do I beg of heaven<BR>
When I am cold in love to you or yours.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Embracing Rivers &amp;c.]</i></blockquote>

KING EDWARD<BR>
A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,<BR>
Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.<BR>
There wanteth now our brother Gloster here,<BR>
To make the bless&egrave;d period of this peace.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
And, in good time, here comes the noble duke.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Enter GLOSTER.]</i></blockquote>

GLOSTER<BR>
Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen;<BR>
And, princely peers, a happy time of day!<BR>
<BR>
KING EDWARD<BR>
Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.<BR>
Gloster, we have done deeds of charity;<BR>
Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate,<BR>
Between these swelling wrong-incens&egrave;d peers.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
A blessed labour, my most sovereign lord,&#8212;<BR>
Among this princely heap, if any here,<BR>
By false intelligence or wrong surmise,<BR>
Hold me a foe;<BR>
If I unwittingly, or in my rage,<BR>
Have aught committed that is hardly borne<BR>
To any in this presence, I desire<BR>
To reconcile me to his friendly peace:<BR>
'Tis death to me to be at enmity;<BR>
I hate it, and desire all good men's love.&#8212;<BR>
First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,<BR>
Which I will purchase with my duteous service;&#8212;<BR>
Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,<BR>
If ever any grudge were lodg'd between us;&#8212;<BR>
Of you, and you, Lord Rivers, and of Dorset,<BR>
That all without desert have frown'd on me;<BR>
Of you, Lord Woodville, and, Lord Scales, of you;&#8212;<BR>
Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen;&#8212;indeed, of all.<BR>
I do not know that Englishman alive<BR>
With whom my soul is any jot at odds<BR>
More than the infant that is born to-night:<BR>
I thank my God for my humility.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:&#8212;<BR>
I would to God all strifes were well compounded.&#8212;<BR>
My sovereign lord, I do beseech your highness<BR>
To take our brother Clarence to your grace.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Why, madam, have I off'red love for this,<BR>
To be so flouted in this royal presence?<BR>
Who knows not that the gentle duke is dead?<BR>

<blockquote><i>[They all start.]</i></blockquote>

You do him injury to scorn his corse.<BR>
<BR>
KING EDWARD<BR>
Who knows not he is dead! Who knows he is?<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
All-seeing heaven, what a world is this!<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?<BR>
<BR>
DORSET<BR>
Ay, my good lord; and no man in the presence<BR>
But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.<BR>
<BR>
KING EDWARD<BR>
Is Clarence dead? the order was revers'd.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
But he, poor man, by your first order died,<BR>
And that a wing&egrave;d Mercury did bear;<BR>
Some tardy cripple bore the countermand<BR>
That came too lag to see him buri&egrave;d.<BR>
God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,<BR>
Nearer in bloody thoughts, an not in blood,<BR>
Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,<BR>
And yet go current from suspicion!<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Enter Stanley.]</i></blockquote>

STANLEY<BR>
A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!<BR>
<BR>
KING EDWARD<BR>
I pr'ythee, peace: my soul is full of sorrow.<BR>
<BR>
STANLEY<BR>
I Will not rise unless your highness hear me.<BR>
<BR>
KING EDWARD<BR>
Then say at once what is it thou request'st.<BR>
<BR>
STANLEY<BR>
The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;<BR>
Who slew to-day a riotous gentleman<BR>
Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.<BR>
<BR>
KING EDWARD<BR>
Have I a tongue to doom my brother's death,<BR>
And shall that tongue give pardon to a slave?<BR>
My brother kill'd no man,&#8212;his fault was thought,<BR>
And yet his punishment was bitter death.<BR>
Who su'd to me for him? who, in my wrath,<BR>
Kneel'd at my feet, and bid me be advis'd?<BR>
Who spoke of brotherhood? who spoke of love?<BR>
Who told me how the poor soul did forsake<BR>
The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?<BR>
Who told me, in the field at Tewksbury,<BR>
When Oxford had me down, he rescu'd me,<BR>
And said "Dear brother, live, and be a king"?<BR>
Who told me, when we both lay in the field<BR>
Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me<BR>
Even in his garments, and did give himself,<BR>
All thin and naked, to the numb-cold night?<BR>
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath<BR>
Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you<BR>
Had so much grace to put it in my mind.<BR>
But when your carters or your waiting-vassals<BR>
Have done a drunken slaughter, and defac'd<BR>
The precious image of our dear Redeemer,<BR>
You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;<BR>
And I, unjustly too, must grant it you:&#8212;<BR>
But for my brother not a man would speak,&#8212;<BR>
Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself<BR>
For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all<BR>
Have been beholding to him in his life;<BR>
Yet none of you would once beg for his life.&#8212;<BR>
O God, I fear Thy justice will take hold<BR>
On me, and you, and mine, and yours, for this!<BR>
Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.<BR>
Ah, poor Clarence!<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exeunt KING, QUEEN, HASTINGS, RIVERS, DORSET, and GREY.]</i></blockquote>

GLOSTER<BR>
This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not<BR>
How that the guilty kindred of the queen<BR>
Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?<BR>
O, they did urge it still unto the king!<BR>
God will revenge it.&#8212;Come, lords, will you go<BR>
To comfort Edward with our company?<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
We wait upon your grace.<BR>

SON<BR>
Good grandam, tell us, is our father dead?<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
No, boy.<BR>
<BR>
DAUGHTER<BR>
Why do you weep so oft, and beat your breast,<BR>
And cry "O Clarence, my unhappy son!"<BR>
<BR>
SON<BR>
Why do you look on us, and shake your head,<BR>
And call us orphans, wretches, castaways,<BR>
If that our noble father were alive?<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
My pretty cousins, you mistake me both;<BR>
I do lament the sickness of the king,<BR>
As loath to lose him, not your father's death;<BR>
It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.<BR>
<BR>
SON<BR>
Then you conclude, my grandam, he is dead.<BR>
The king mine uncle is to blame for this:<BR>
God will revenge it; whom I will importune<BR>
With earnest prayers all to that effect.<BR>
<BR>
DAUGHTER<BR>
And so will I.<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well:<BR>
Incapable and shallow innocents,<BR>
You cannot guess who caus'd your father's death.<BR>
<BR>
SON<BR>
Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloster<BR>
Told me, the king, provok'd to it by the queen,<BR>
Devis'd impeachments to imprison him:<BR>
And when my uncle told me so, he wept,<BR>
And pitied me, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;<BR>
Bade me rely on him as on my father,<BR>
And he would love me dearly as his child.<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
Ah, that deceit should steal such gentle shape,<BR>
And with a virtuous visard hide deep vice!<BR>
He is my son; ay, and therein my shame;<BR>
Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.<BR>
<BR>
SON<BR>
Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
Ay, boy.<BR>
<BR>
SON<BR>
I cannot think it.&#8212;Hark! what noise is this?<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, distractedly; RIVERS and DORSET following her.]</i></blockquote>

QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Ah, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,<BR>
To chide my fortune, and torment myself?<BR>
I'll join with black despair against my soul,<BR>
And to myself become an enemy.<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
What means this scene of rude impatience?<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
To make an act of tragic violence:&#8212;<BR>
Edward, my lord, thy son, our king, is dead.&#8212;<BR>
Why grow the branches when the root is gone?<BR>
Why wither not the leaves that want their sap?&#8212;<BR>
If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,<BR>
That our swift-wing&egrave;d souls may catch the king's;<BR>
Or, like obedient subjects, follow him<BR>
To his new kingdom of perpetual rest.<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow<BR>
As I had title in thy noble husband!<BR>
I have bewept a worthy husband's death,<BR>
And liv'd by looking on his images:<BR>
But now two mirrors of his princely semblance<BR>
Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,<BR>
And I for comfort have but one false glass,<BR>
That grieves me when I see my shame in him.<BR>
Thou art a widow, yet thou art a mother,<BR>
And hast the comfort of thy children left;<BR>
But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,<BR>
And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble hands,&#8212;<BR>
Clarence and Edward. O, what cause have I,&#8212;<BR>
Thine being but a moiety of my moan,&#8212;<BR>
To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries?<BR>
<BR>
SON<BR>
Ah, aunt, you wept not for our father's death!<BR>
How can we aid you with our kindred tears?<BR>
<BR>
DAUGHTER<BR>
Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd,<BR>
Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Give me no help in lamentation;<BR>
I am not barren to bring forth complaints:<BR>
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,<BR>
That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,<BR>
May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!<BR>
Ah for my husband, for my dear Lord Edward!<BR>
<BR>
CHILDREN<BR>
Ah for our father, for our dear Lord Clarence!<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!<BR>

What stays had I but they? and they are gone.<BR>

Was never widow had so dear a loss!<BR>
<BR>
CHILDREN<BR>
Were never orphans had so dear a loss!<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
Was never mother had so dear a loss!<BR>
Alas, I am the mother of these griefs!<BR>
Their woes are parcell'd, mine is general.<BR>
She for an Edward weeps, and so do I:<BR>
I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she:<BR>
These babes for Clarence weep, and so do I;<BR>
I for an Edward weep, so do not they:&#8212;<BR>
Alas, you three, on me, threefold distress'd,<BR>
Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,<BR>
And I will pamper it with lamentation.<BR>
<BR>
DORSET<BR>
Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeas'd<BR>
That you take with unthankfulness His doing:<BR>
In common worldly things 'tis called ungrateful,<BR>
With dull unwillingness to repay a debt<BR>
Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;<BR>
Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,<BR>
For it requires the royal debt it lent you.<BR>
<BR>
RIVERS<BR>
Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,<BR>
Of the young prince your son: send straight for him;<BR>
Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives.<BR>
Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,<BR>
And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Enter GLOSTER, BUCKINGHAM, STANLEY, HASTINGS, RATCLIFF and others.]</i></blockquote>

GLOSTER<BR>
Sister, have comfort: all of us have cause<BR>
To wail the dimming of our shining star;<BR>
But none can help our harms by wailing them.&#8212;<BR>
Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;<BR>
I did not see your grace:&#8212;humbly on my knee<BR>
I crave your blessing.<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
God bless thee; and put meekness in thy breast,<BR>
Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!<BR>

GLOSTER<BR>
Amen!<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And make me die a good old man!&#8212;<BR>
That is the butt end of a mother's blessing;<BR>
I marvel that her grace did leave it out.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,<BR>
That bear this heavy mutual load of moan,<BR>
Now cheer each other in each other's love:<BR>
Though we have spent our harvest of this king,<BR>
We are to reap the harvest of his son.<BR>
The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,<BR>
But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,<BR>
Must gently be preserv'd, cherish'd, and kept;<BR>
Me seemeth good that, with some little train,<BR>
Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetched<BR>
Hither to London, to be crown'd our king.<BR>
<BR>
RIVERS<BR>
Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Marry, my lord, lest by a multitude,<BR>
The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out;<BR>
Which would be so much the more dangerous<BR>
By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:<BR>
Where every horse bears his commanding rein<BR>
And may direct his course as please himself,<BR>
As well the fear of harm as harm apparent,<BR>
In my opinion, ought to be prevented.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
I hope the king made peace with all of us;<BR>
And the compact is firm and true in me.<BR>
<BR>
RIVERS<BR>
And so in me; and so, I think, in all:<BR>
Yet, since it is but green, it should be put<BR>
To no apparent likelihood of breach,<BR>
Which haply by much company might be urg'd:<BR>
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,<BR>
That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.<BR>
<BR>
HASTINGS<BR>
And so say I.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Then be it so; and go we to determine<BR>
Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.<BR>
Madam,&#8212;and you, my mother,&#8212;will you go<BR>
To give your censures in this business?<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM and GLOSTER.]</i></blockquote>

BUCKINGHAM<BR>
My lord, whoever journeys to the prince,<BR>
For God'd sake, let not us two stay at home;<BR>
For by the way I'll sort occasion,<BR>
As index to the story we late talk'd of,<BR>
To part the queen's proud kindred from the Prince.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
My other self, my counsel's consistory,<BR>
My oracle, my prophet!&#8212;my dear cousin,<BR>
I, as a child, will go by thy direction.<BR>
Toward Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.<BR>

No, no; by God's good grace, his son shall reign.<BR>

Last night, I hear, they at Northampton lay;<BR>

To-morrow or next day they will be here.<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
I long with all my heart to see the prince:<BR>
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
But I hear no; they say my son of York<BR>
Has almost overta'en him in his growth.<BR>
<BR>
YORK<BR>
Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
Why, my good cousin? it is good to grow.<BR>
<BR>
YORK<BR>
Grandam, one night as we did sit at supper,<BR>
My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow<BR>
More than my brother. "Ay," quoth my uncle Gloster,<BR>
"Small herbs have grace: great weeds do grow apace."<BR>
And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,<BR>
Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold<BR>
In him that did object the same to thee:<BR>
He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,<BR>
So long a growing and so leisurely,<BR>
That, if his rule were true, he should be gracious.<BR>
<BR>
ARCHBISHOP<BR>
And so no doubt he is, my gracious madam.<BR>

DUCHESS<BR>
I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.<BR>

YORK<BR>
Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd,<BR>
I could have given my uncle's grace a flout<BR>
To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.<BR>

DUCHESS<BR>
How, my young York? I pr'ythee let me hear it.<BR>
<BR>
YORK<BR>
Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast<BR>
That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old:<BR>
'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.<BR>
Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
I pr'ythee, pretty York, who told thee this?<BR>

The tiger now hath seiz'd the gentle hind;<BR>
Insulting tyranny begins to jet<BR>
Upon the innocent and aweless throne:&#8212;<BR>
Welcome, destruction, blood, and massacre!<BR>
I see, as in a map, the end of all.<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
Accurs&egrave;d and unquiet wrangling days<BR>
How many of you have mine eyes beheld?<BR>
My husband lost his life to get the crown;<BR>
And often up and down my sons were toss'd<BR>
For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:<BR>
And being seated, and domestic broils<BR>
Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors<BR>
Make war upon themselves; brother to brother,<BR>
Blood to blood, self against self: O, preposterous<BR>
And frantic outrage, end thy damn&egrave;d spleen;<BR>
Or let me die, to look on death no more!<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.&#8212;<BR>
Madam, farewell.<BR>

BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign:<BR>
The weary way hath made you melancholy.<BR>
<BR>
PRINCE<BR>
No, uncle; but our crosses on the way<BR>
Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy:<BR>
I want more uncles here to welcome me.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years<BR>
Hath not yet div'd into the world's deceit:<BR>
Nor more can you distinguish of a man<BR>
Than of his outward show; which, God He knows,<BR>
Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.<BR>
Those uncles which you want were dangerous;<BR>
Your grace attended to their sugar'd words<BR>
But look'd not on the poison of their hearts:<BR>
God keep you from them and from such false friends!<BR>
<BR>
PRINCE<BR>
God keep me from false friends! but they were none.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Enter the LORD MAYOR and his train.]</i></blockquote>

MAYOR<BR>
God bless your grace with health and happy days!<BR>
<BR>
PRINCE<BR>
I thank you, good my lord;&#8212;and thank you all.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exeunt MAYOR, &amp;c.]</i></blockquote>

I thought my mother and my brother York<BR>
Would long ere this have met us on the way:<BR>
Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not<BR>
To tell us whether they will come or no!<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Enter HASTINGS.]</i></blockquote>

PRINCE<BR>
Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?<BR>
<BR>
HASTINGS<BR>
On what occasion, God He knows, not I,<BR>
The queen your mother and your brother York<BR>
Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince<BR>
Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,<BR>
But by his mother was perforce withheld.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Fie, what an indirect and peevish course<BR>
Is this of hers?&#8212;Lord cardinal, will your grace<BR>
Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York<BR>
Unto his princely brother presently?<BR>
If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,<BR>
And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.<BR>
<BR>
CARDINAL<BR>
My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory<BR>
Can from his mother win the Duke of York,<BR>
Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate<BR>
To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid<BR>
We should infringe the holy privilege<BR>
Of bless&egrave;d sanctuary! not for all this land<BR>
Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
You are too senseless-obstinate, my lord,<BR>
Too ceremonious and traditional:<BR>
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,<BR>
You break not sanctuary in seizing him.<BR>
The benefit thereof is always granted<BR>
To those whose dealings have deserv'd the place<BR>
And those who have the wit to claim the place:<BR>
This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserv'd it;<BR>
And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:<BR>
Then, taking him from thence that is not there,<BR>
You break no privilege nor charter there.<BR>
Oft have I heard of sanctuary-men;<BR>
But sanctuary-children ne'er till now.<BR>
<BR>
CARDINAL<BR>
My lord, you shall o'errule my mind for once.&#8212;<BR>
Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?<BR>
<BR>
HASTINGS<BR>
I go, my lord.<BR>
<BR>
PRINCE<BR>
Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exeunt CARDINAL and HASTINGS.]</i></blockquote>

Say, uncle Gloster, if our brother come,<BR>
Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Where it seems best unto your royal self.<BR>
If I may counsel you, some day or two<BR>
Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:<BR>
Then where you please and shall be thought most fit<BR>
For your best health and recreation.<BR>
<BR>
PRINCE<BR>
I do not like the Tower, of any place.&#8212;<BR>
Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;<BR>
Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.<BR>
<BR>
PRINCE<BR>
Is it upon rec&oacute;rd, or else reported<BR>
Successively from age to age, he built it?<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Upon rec&oacute;rd, my gracious lord.<BR>
<BR>
PRINCE<BR>
But say, my lord, it were not register'd,<BR>
Methinks the truth should live from age to age,<BR>
As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,<BR>
Even to the general all-ending day.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Aside]</i></blockquote>

So wise so young, they say, do never live long.<BR>
<BR>
PRINCE<BR>
What say you, uncle?<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
I say, without characters, fame lives long.&#8212;<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Aside]</i></blockquote>

Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,<BR>
I moralize two meanings in one word.<BR>
<BR>
PRINCE<BR>
That Julius Caesar was a famous man;<BR>
With what his valour did enrich his wit,<BR>
His wit set down to make his valour live;<BR>
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;<BR>
For now he lives in fame, though not in life.&#8212;<BR>
I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,&#8212;<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
What, my gracious lord?<BR>
<BR>
PRINCE<BR>
An if I live until I be a man,<BR>
I'll win our ancient right in France again,<BR>
Or die a soldier as I liv'd a king.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Aside]</i></blockquote>

Short summers lightly have a forward spring.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Enter YORK, HASTINGS, and the CARDINAL.]</i></blockquote>

PRINCE<BR>
Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?<BR>
<BR>
YORK<BR>
Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.<BR>
<BR>
PRINCE<BR>
Ay brother,&#8212;to our grief, as it is yours:<BR>
Too late he died that might have kept that title,<BR>
Which by his death hath lost much majesty.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?<BR>
<BR>
YORK<BR>
I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,<BR>
You said that idle weeds are fast in growth:<BR>
The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
He hath, my lord.<BR>
<BR>
YORK<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And therefore is he idle?<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.<BR>
<BR>
YORK<BR>
Then he is more beholding to you than I.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
He may command me as my sovereign;<BR>
But you have power in me as in a kinsman.<BR>
<BR>
YORK<BR>
I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart!<BR>
<BR>
PRINCE<BR>
A beggar, brother?<BR>
<BR>
YORK<BR>
Of my kind uncle, that I know will give,<BR>
And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.<BR>
<BR>
YORK<BR>
A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it!<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.<BR>
<BR>
YORK<BR>
O, then, I see you will part but with light gifts;<BR>
In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
It is too heavy for your grace to wear.<BR>
<BR>
YORK<BR>
I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
What, would you have my weapon, little lord?<BR>
<BR>
YORK<BR>
I would, that I might thank you as you call me.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
How?<BR>
<BR>
YORK<BR>
Little.<BR>
<BR>
PRINCE<BR>
My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:&#8212;<BR>
Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.<BR>
<BR>
YORK<BR>
You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:&#8212;<BR>
Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;<BR>
Because that I am little, like an ape,<BR>
He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!<BR>
To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,<BR>
He prettily and aptly taunts himself:<BR>
So cunning and so young is wonderful.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
My lord, wil't please you pass along?<BR>
Myself and my good cousin Buckingham<BR>
Will to your mother, to entreat of her<BR>
To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.<BR>
<BR>
YORK<BR>
What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?<BR>
<BR>
PRINCE<BR>
My lord protector needs will have it so.<BR>
<BR>
YORK<BR>
I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Why, what should you fear?<BR>
<BR>
YORK<BR>
Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:<BR>
My grandam told me he was murder'd there.<BR>
<BR>
PRINCE<BR>
I fear no uncles dead.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Nor none that live, I hope.<BR>
<BR>
PRINCE<BR>
An if they live, I hope I need not fear.<BR>
But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,<BR>
Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Sennet. Exeunt PRINCE, YORK, HASTINGS, CARDINAL, and Attendants.]</i></blockquote>

BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Think you, my lord, this little prating York<BR>
Was not incens&egrave;d by his subtle mother<BR>
To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
No doubt, no doubt: O, 'tis a parlous boy;<BR>
Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable:<BR>
He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Well, let them rest.&#8212;Come hither, Catesby.<BR>
Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend<BR>
As closely to conceal what we impart:<BR>
Thou know'st our reasons urg'd upon the way;&#8212;<BR>
What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter<BR>
To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,<BR>
For the instalment of this noble duke<BR>
In the seat royal of this famous isle?<BR>
<BR>
CATESBY<BR>
He for his father's sake so loves the prince<BR>
That he will not be won to aught against him.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
What think'st thou then of Stanley? will not he?<BR>
<BR>
CATESBY<BR>
He will do all in all as Hastings doth.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Well then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,<BR>
And, as it were far off, sound thou Lord Hastings<BR>
How he doth stand affected to our purpose;<BR>
And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,<BR>
To sit about the coronation.<BR>
If thou dost find him tractable to us,<BR>
Encourage him, and tell him all our reasons:<BR>
If he be leaden, icy, cold, unwilling,<BR>
Be thou so too; and so break off the talk,<BR>
And give us notice of his inclination:<BR>
For we to-morrow hold divided councils,<BR>
Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,<BR>
His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries<BR>
To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle;<BR>
And bid my lord, for joy of this good news,<BR>
Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly.<BR>
<BR>
CATESBY<BR>
My good lords both, with all the heed I can.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?<BR>
<BR>
CATESBY<BR>
You shall, my lord.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exit CATESBY.]</i></blockquote>

BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Now, my lord, what shall we do if we perceive<BR>
Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Chop off his head. man;&#8212;somewhat we will do:&#8212;<BR>
And, look when I am king, claim thou of me<BR>
The earldom of Hereford, and all the movables<BR>
Whereof the king my brother was possess'd.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
I'll claim that promise at your grace's hand.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
And look to have it yielded with all kindness.<BR>
Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards<BR>
We may digest our complots in some form.<BR>

So it appears by that I have to say.<BR>
First, he commends him to your noble self.<BR>
<BR>
HASTINGS<BR>
What then?<BR>
<BR>
MESSENGER<BR>
Then certifies your lordship that this night<BR>
He dreamt the boar had razed off his helm:<BR>
Besides, he says there are two councils held;<BR>
And that may be determin'd at the one<BR>
Which may make you and him to rue at the other.<BR>
Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,&#8212;<BR>
If you will presently take horse with him,<BR>
And with all speed post with him toward the north,<BR>
To shun the danger that his soul divines.<BR>
<BR>
HASTINGS<BR>
Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;<BR>
Bid him not fear the separated councils:<BR>
His honour and myself are at the one,<BR>
And at the other is my good friend Catesby;<BR>
Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us<BR>
Whereof I shall not have intelligence.<BR>
Tell him his fears are shallow, without instance:<BR>
And for his dreams, I wonder he's so simple<BR>
To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers:<BR>
To fly the boar before the boar pursues<BR>
Were to incense the boar to follow us,<BR>
And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.<BR>
Go, bid thy master rise and come to me;<BR>
And we will both together to the Tower,<BR>
Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.<BR>

MESSENGER<BR>
I'll go, my lord, and tell him what you say.<BR>

CATESBY<BR>
Many good morrows to my noble lord!<BR>
<BR>
HASTINGS<BR>
Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring:<BR>
What news, what news, in this our tottering state?<BR>
<BR>
CATESBY<BR>
It is a reeling world indeed, my lord;<BR>
And I believe will never stand upright<BR>
Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.<BR>
<BR>
HASTINGS<BR>
How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?<BR>
<BR>
CATESBY<BR>
Ay, my good lord.<BR>
<BR>
HASTINGS<BR>
I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders<BR>
Before I'll see the crown so foul misplac'd.<BR>
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?<BR>
<BR>
CATESBY<BR>
Ay, on my life; and hopes to find you forward<BR>
Upon his party for the gain thereof:<BR>
And thereupon he sends you this good news,&#8212;<BR>
That this same very day your enemies,<BR>
The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.<BR>
<BR>
HASTINGS<BR>
Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,<BR>
Because they have been still my adversaries:<BR>
But that I'll give my voice on Richard's side<BR>
To bar my master's heirs in true descent,<BR>
God knows I will not do it to the death.<BR>
<BR>
CATESBY<BR>
God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!<BR>
<BR>
HASTINGS<BR>
But I shall laugh at this a twelve month hence,&#8212;<BR>
That they which brought me in my master's hate,<BR>
I live to look upon their tragedy.<BR>
Well, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older,<BR>
I'll send some packing that yet think not on't.<BR>
<BR>
CATESBY<BR>
'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,<BR>
When men are unprepar'd and look not for it.<BR>
<BR>
HASTINGS<BR>
O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out<BR>
With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do<BR>
With some men else that think themselves as safe<BR>
As thou and I; who, as thou knowest, are dear<BR>
To princely Richard and to Buckingham.<BR>

You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,<BR>
I do not like these several councils, I.<BR>
<BR>
HASTINGS<BR>
My lord, I hold my life as dear as you do yours;<BR>
And never in my days, I do protest,<BR>
Was it so precious to me as 'tis now;<BR>
Think you, but that I know our state secure,<BR>
I would be so triumphant as I am?<BR>
<BR>
STANLEY<BR>
The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,<BR>
Were jocund and suppos'd their states were sure,&#8212;<BR>
And they, indeed, had no cause to mistrust;<BR>
But yet, you see, how soon the day o'ercast!<BR>
This sudden stab of rancour I misdoubt;<BR>

What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.<BR>

Come, come, have with you.&#8212;Wot you what, my lord?<BR>
To-day the lords you talk'd of are beheaded.<BR>

Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest;<BR>
Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.<BR>

Good faith, and when I met this holy man,<BR>
The men you talk of came into my mind.&#8212;<BR>
What, go you toward the Tower?<BR>

I do, my lord, but long I cannot stay there;<BR>

In God's name speak,&#8212;when is the royal day?<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Are all things ready for that royal time?<BR>
<BR>
STANLEY<BR>
Thery are, and wants but nomination.<BR>
<BR>
ELY<BR>
To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?<BR>
Who is most inward with the noble duke?<BR>
<BR>
ELY<BR>
Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
We know each other's faces: for our hearts,<BR>
He knows no more of mine than I of yours;<BR>
Or I of his, my lord, than you of mine.&#8212;<BR>
Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.<BR>
<BR>
HASTINGS<BR>
I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;<BR>
But for his purpose in the coronation<BR>
I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd<BR>
His gracious pleasure any way therein:<BR>
But you, my honourable lords, may name the time;<BR>
And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,<BR>
Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.<BR>
<BR>
ELY<BR>
In happy time, here comes the duke himself.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Enter GLOSTER.]</i></blockquote>

GLOSTER<BR>
My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.<BR>
I have been long a sleeper; but I trust<BR>
My absence doth neglect no great design<BR>
Which by my presence might have been concluded.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Had you not come upon your cue, my lord,<BR>
William Lord Hastings had pronounc'd your part,&#8212;<BR>
I mean, your voice,&#8212;for crowning of the king.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;<BR>
His lordship knows me well and loves me well.&#8212;<BR>
My lord of Ely, when I was last in Holborn<BR>
I saw good strawberries in your garden there:<BR>
I do beseech you send for some of them.<BR>
<BR>
ELY<BR>
Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exit.]</i></blockquote>

GLOSTER<BR>
Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Takes him aside.]</i></blockquote>

Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,<BR>
And finds the testy gentleman so hot<BR>
That he will lose his head ere give consent<BR>
His master's child, as worshipfully he terms it,<BR>
Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Withdraw yourself awhile; I'll go with you.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exeunt GLOSTER and BUCKINGHAM.]</i></blockquote>

STANLEY<BR>
We have not yet set down this day of triumph.<BR>
To-morrow, in my judgment, is too sudden;<BR>
For I myself am not so well provided<BR>
As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Re-enter BISHOP OF ELY.]</i></blockquote>

ELY<BR>
Where is my lord the Duke of Gloster?<BR>
I have sent for these strawberries.<BR>
<BR>
HASTINGS<BR>
His grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning;<BR>
There's some conceit or other likes him well<BR>
When that he bids good morrow with such spirit.<BR>
I think there's ne'er a man in Christendom<BR>
Can lesser hide his love or hate than he;<BR>
For by his face straight shall you know his heart.<BR>
<BR>
STANLEY<BR>
What of his heart perceive you in his face<BR>
By any livelihood he showed to-day?<BR>
<BR>
HASTINGS<BR>
Marry, that with no man here he is offended;<BR>
For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Re-enter GLOSTER and BUCKINGHAM.]</i></blockquote>

GLOSTER<BR>
I pray you all, tell me what they deserve<BR>
That do conspire my death with devilish plots<BR>
Of damn&egrave;d witchcraft, and that have prevail'd<BR>
Upon my body with their hellish charms?<BR>
<BR>
HASTINGS<BR>
The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,<BR>
Makes me most forward in this princely presence<BR>
To doom the offenders: whosoe'er they be.<BR>
I say, my lord, they have deserv&egrave;d death.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Then be your eyes the witness of their evil:<BR>
Look how I am bewitch'd; behold, mine arm<BR>
Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:<BR>
And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,<BR>
Consorted with that harlot-strumpet Shore,<BR>
That by their witchcraft thus have mark&egrave;d me.<BR>
<BR>
HASTINGS<BR>
If they have done this deed, my noble lord,&#8212;<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
If!&#8212;thou protector of this damn&egrave;d strumpet,<BR>
Talk'st thou to me of "ifs"?&#8212;Thou art a traitor:&#8212;<BR>
Off with his head!&#8212;now, by Saint Paul I swear,<BR>
I will not dine until I see the same.&#8212;<BR>
Lovel and Ratcliff:&#8212;look that it be done:&#8212;<BR>
The rest, that love me, rise and follow me.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exeunt all except HASTINGS, LOVEL, and RATCLIFF.]</i></blockquote>

HASTINGS<BR>
Woe, woe, for England! not a whit for me;<BR>
For I, too fond, might have prevented this.<BR>
Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;<BR>
And I did scorn it, and disdain to fly.<BR>
Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,<BR>
And started, when he look'd upon the Tower,<BR>
As loth to bear me to the slaughter-house.<BR>
O, now I need the priest that spake to me:<BR>
I now repent I told the pursuivant,<BR>
As too triumphing, how mine enemies<BR>
To-day at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,<BR>
And I myself secure in grace and favour.<BR>
O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse<BR>
Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!<BR>
<BR>
RATCLIFF<BR>
Come, come, despatch; the duke would be at dinner:<BR>
Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.<BR>
<BR>
HASTINGS<BR>
O momentary grace of mortal men,<BR>
Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!<BR>
Who builds his hope in air of your good looks<BR>
Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,<BR>
Ready, with every nod, to tumble down<BR>
Into the fatal bowels of the deep.<BR>
<BR>
LOVEL<BR>
Come, come, despatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.<BR>
<BR>
HASTINGS<BR>
O bloody Richard!&#8212;miserable England!<BR>
I prophesy the fearfull'st time to thee<BR>
That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.&#8212;<BR>
Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head:<BR>
They smile at me who shortly shall be dead.<BR>

GLOSTER<BR>
Come, cousin, canst thou quake and change thy colour,<BR>
Murder thy breath in middle of a word,<BR>
And then again begin, and stop again,<BR>
As if thou were distraught and mad with terror?<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;<BR>
Speak and look back, and pry on every side,<BR>
Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,<BR>
Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks<BR>
Are at my service, like enforc&egrave;d smiles;<BR>
And both are ready in their offices,<BR>
At any time to grace my stratagems.<BR>
But what, is Catesby gone?<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Enter the LORD MAYOR and CATESBY.]</i></blockquote>

BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Lord mayor,&#8212;<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Look to the drawbridge there!<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Hark! a drum.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Catesby, o'erlook the walls.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent,&#8212;<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Look back, defend thee,&#8212;here are enemies.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
God and our innocency defend and guard us!<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Be patient; they are friends,&#8212;Ratcliff and Lovel.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Enter LOVEL and RATCLIFF, with HASTINGS' head.]</i></blockquote>

LOVEL<BR>
Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,<BR>
The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
So dear I lov'd the man that I must weep.<BR>
I took him for the plainest harmless creature<BR>
That breath'd upon the earth a Christian;<BR>
Made him my book, wherein my soul recorded<BR>
The history of all her secret thoughts:<BR>
So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue<BR>
That, his apparent open guilt omitted,&#8212;<BR>
I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,&#8212;<BR>
He liv'd from all attainder of susp&eacute;cts.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor<BR>
That ever liv'd.&#8212;<BR>
Would you imagine, or almost believe,&#8212;<BR>
Were't not that by great preservation<BR>
We live to tell it you,&#8212;that the subtle traitor<BR>
This day had plotted, in the council-house,<BR>
To murder me and my good Lord of Gloster!<BR>
<BR>
MAYOR<BR>
Had he done so?<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
What! think you we are Turks or Infidels?<BR>
Or that we would, against the form of law,<BR>
Proceed thus rashly in the villain's death,<BR>
But that the extreme peril of the case,<BR>
The peace of England and our persons' safety,<BR>
Enforc'd us to this execution?<BR>
<BR>
MAYOR<BR>
Now, fair befall you! he deserv'd his death;<BR>
And your good graces both have well proceeded,<BR>
To warn false traitors from the like attempts.<BR>
I never look'd for better at his hands<BR>
After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Yet had we not determin'd he should die<BR>
Until your lordship came to see his end;<BR>
Which now the loving haste of these our friends,<BR>
Something against our meanings, have prevented:<BR>
Because, my lord, we would have had you heard<BR>
The traitor speak, and timorously confess<BR>
The manner and the purpose of his treasons;<BR>
That you might well have signified the same<BR>
Unto the citizens, who haply may<BR>
Misconster us in him, and wail his death.<BR>
<BR>
MAYOR<BR>
But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve<BR>
As well as I had seen and heard him speak:<BR>
And do not doubt, right noble princes both,<BR>
But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens<BR>
With all your just proceedings in this case.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
And to that end we wish'd your lordship here,<BR>
To avoid the the the censures of the carping world.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
But since you come too late of our intent,<BR>
Yet witness what you hear we did intend:<BR>
And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exit LORD MAYOR.]</i></blockquote>

GLOSTER<BR>
Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.<BR>
The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:&#8212;<BR>
There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,<BR>
Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:<BR>
Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,<BR>
Only for saying he would make his son<BR>
Heir to the crown;&#8212;meaning, indeed, his house,<BR>
Which, by the sign thereof, was term&egrave;d so.<BR>
Moreover, urge his hateful luxury,<BR>
And bestial appetite in change of lust;<BR>
Which stretch'd unto their servants, daughters, wives,<BR>
Even where his raging eye or savage heart,<BR>
Without control, listed to make a prey.<BR>
Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:&#8212;<BR>
Tell them, when that my mother went with child<BR>
Of that insatiate Edward, noble York,<BR>
My princely father, then had wars in France<BR>
And, by true computation of the time,<BR>
Found that the issue was not his begot;<BR>
Which well appear&egrave;d in his lineaments,<BR>
Being nothing like the noble duke my father.<BR>
Yet touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off;<BR>
Because, my lord, you know my mother lives.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Doubt not, my lord, I'll play the orator<BR>
As if the golden fee for which I plead<BR>
Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle;<BR>
Where you shall find me well accompanied<BR>
With reverend fathers and well learned bishops.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
I go; and towards three or four o'clock<BR>
Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exit.]</i></blockquote>

GLOSTER<BR>
Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw.&#8212;<BR>
Go thou <i>[to CATESBY]</i> to Friar Penker;&#8212;bid them both<BR>
Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exeunt LOVEL and CATESBY.]</i></blockquote>

Now will I in, to take some privy order<BR>
To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;<BR>
And to give order that no manner person<BR>
Have any time recourse unto the princes.<BR>

SCRIVENER<BR>
Here is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;<BR>
Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd,<BR>
That it may be to-day read o'er in Paul's.<BR>
And mark how well the sequel hangs together:&#8212;<BR>
Eleven hours I have spent to write it over,<BR>
For yesternight by Catesby was it sent me;<BR>
The precedent was full as long a-doing:<BR>
And yet within these five hours Hastings liv'd,<BR>
Untainted, unexamin'd, free, at liberty.<BR>
Here's a good world the while! Who is so gross<BR>
That cannot see this palpable device!<BR>
Yet who so bold but says he sees it not!<BR>
Bad is the world; and all will come to naught,<BR>
When such ill dealing must be seen in thought.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Enter GLOSTER and BUCKINGHAM, meeting.]</i></blockquote>

GLOSTER<BR>
How now, how now! what say the citizens?<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,<BR>
The citizens are mum, say not a word.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
I did; with his contr&aacute;ct with Lady Lucy,<BR>
And his contr&aacute;ct by deputy in France;<BR>
The insatiate greediness of his desires,<BR>
And his enforcement of the city wives;<BR>
His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,&#8212;<BR>
As being got, your father then in France,<BR>
And his resemblance, being not like the duke:<BR>
Withal I did infer your lineaments,&#8212;<BR>
Being the right idea of your father,<BR>
Both in your form and nobleness of mind;<BR>
Laid open all your victories in Scotland,<BR>
Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace,<BR>
Your bounty, virtue, fair humility;<BR>
Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose<BR>
Untouch'd or slightly handled in discourse:<BR>
And when mine oratory drew toward end<BR>
I bid them that did love their country's good<BR>
Cry "God save Richard, England's royal king!"<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
And did they so?<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
No, so God help me, they spake not a word;<BR>
But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,<BR>
Star'd each on other, and look'd deadly pale.<BR>
Which when I saw, I reprehended them;<BR>
And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:<BR>
His answer was&#8212;the people were not us'd<BR>
To be spoke to but by the recorder.<BR>
Then he was urg'd to tell my tale again,&#8212;<BR>
"Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;"<BR>
But nothing spoke in warrant from himself.<BR>
When he had done, some followers of mine own,<BR>
At lower end of the hall hurl'd up their caps,<BR>
And some ten voices cried, "God save King Richard!"<BR>
And thus I took the vantage of those few,&#8212;<BR>
"Thanks, gentle citizens and friends," quoth I;<BR>
"This general applause and cheerful shout<BR>
Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:"<BR>
And even here brake off and came away.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
What, tongueless blocks were they! would they not speak?<BR>
Will not the mayor, then, and his brethren, come?<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
The mayor is here at hand. Intend some fear;<BR>
Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit:<BR>
And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,<BR>
And stand between two churchmen, good my lord;<BR>
For on that ground I'll make a holy descant:<BR>
And be not easily won to our requests;<BR>
Play the maid's part,&#8212;still answer nay, and take it.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
I go; and if you plead as well for them<BR>
As I can say nay to thee for myself,<BR>
No doubt we bring it to a happy issue.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exit GLOSTER.]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>[Enter the LORD MAYOR, ALDERMEN, and Citizens.]</i></blockquote>

Welcome, my lord. I dance attendance here;<BR>
I think the duke will not be spoke withal.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Enter, from the Castle, CATESBY.]</i></blockquote>

Now, Catesby,&#8212;what says your lord to my request?<BR>
<BR>
CATESBY<BR>
He doth entreat your grace, my noble lord,<BR>
To visit him to-morrow or next day:<BR>
He is within, with two right reverend fathers,<BR>
Divinely bent to meditation:<BR>
And in no worldly suit would he be mov'd,<BR>
To draw him from his holy exercise.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Return, good Catesby, to the gracious duke;<BR>
Tell him, myself, the mayor and aldermen,<BR>
In deep designs, in matter of great moment,<BR>
No less importing than our general good,<BR>
Are come to have some conference with his grace.<BR>
<BR>
CATESBY<BR>
I'll signify so much unto him straight.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exit.]</i></blockquote>

BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!<BR>
He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,<BR>
But on his knees at meditation;<BR>
Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,<BR>
But meditating with two deep divines;<BR>
Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,<BR>
But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:<BR>
Happy were England would this virtuous prince<BR>
Take on his grace the sovereignty thereof:<BR>
But, sure, I fear, we shall not win him to it.<BR>
<BR>
MAYOR<BR>
Marry, God defend his grace should say us nay!<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
I fear he will. Here Catesby comes again.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Re-enter CATESBY.]</i></blockquote>

Now, Catesby, what says his grace?<BR>
<BR>
CATESBY<BR>
He wonders to what end you have assembled<BR>
Such troops of citizens to come to him:<BR>
His grace not being warn'd thereof before,<BR>
He fears, my lord, you mean no good to him.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Sorry I am my noble cousin should<BR>
Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:<BR>
By heaven, we come to him in perfect love;<BR>
And so once more return and tell his grace.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exit CATESBY.]</i></blockquote>

When holy and devout religious men<BR>
Are at their beads, 'tis much to draw them thence,&#8212;<BR>
So sweet is zealous contemplation.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Enter GLOSTER in a Galery above, between two BISHOPS. CATESBY returns.]</i></blockquote>

MAYOR<BR>
See where his grace stands 'tween two clergymen!<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,<BR>
To stay him from the fall of vanity:<BR>
And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,&#8212;<BR>
True ornaments to know a holy man.&#8212;<BR>
Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,<BR>
Lend favourable ear to our requests;<BR>
And pardon us the interruption<BR>
Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
My lord, there needs no such apology:<BR>
I rather do beseech you pardon me,<BR>
Who, earnest in the service of my God,<BR>
Deferr'd the visitation of my friends.<BR>
But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,<BR>
And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
I do suspect I have done some offence<BR>
That seems disgracious in the city's eye;<BR>
And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,<BR>
On our entreaties, to amend your fault!<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Know then, it is your fault that you resign<BR>
The supreme seat, the throne majestical,<BR>
The scepter'd office of your ancestors,<BR>
Your state of fortune and your due of birth,<BR>
The lineal glory of your royal house,<BR>
To the corruption of a blemish'd stock:<BR>
Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,&#8212;<BR>
Which here we waken to our country's good,&#8212;<BR>
The noble isle doth want her proper limbs;<BR>
Her face defac'd with scars of infamy,<BR>
Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,<BR>
And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf<BR>
Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion.<BR>
Which to recure, we heartily solicit<BR>
Your gracious self to take on you the charge<BR>
And kingly government of this your land;&#8212;<BR>
Not as protector, steward, substitute,<BR>
Or lowly factor for another's gain;<BR>
But as successively, from blood to blood,<BR>
Your right of birth, your empery, your own.<BR>
For this, consorted with the citizens,<BR>
Your very worshipful and loving friends,<BR>
And, by their vehement instigation,<BR>
In this just cause come I to move your grace.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
I cannot tell if to depart in silence<BR>
Or bitterly to speak in your reproof<BR>
Best fitteth my degree or your condition:<BR>
If not to answer, you might haply think<BR>
Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded<BR>
To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,<BR>
Which fondly you would here impose on me;<BR>
If to reprove you for this suit of yours,<BR>
So season'd with your faithful love to me,<BR>
Then, on the other side, I check'd my friends.<BR>
Therefore,&#8212;to speak, and to avoid the first,<BR>
And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,&#8212;<BR>
Definitively thus I answer you.<BR>
Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert<BR>
Unmeritable shuns your high request.<BR>
First, if all obstacles were cut away,<BR>
And that my path were even to the crown,<BR>
As the ripe revenue and due of birth,<BR>
Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,<BR>
So mighty and so many my defects,<BR>
That I would rather hide me from my greatness,&#8212;<BR>
Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,&#8212;<BR>
Than in my greatness covet to be hid,<BR>
And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.<BR>
But, God be thank'd, there is no need of me,&#8212;<BR>
And much I need to help you, were there need;&#8212;<BR>
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,<BR>
Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,<BR>
Will well become the seat of majesty,<BR>
And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.<BR>
On him I lay that you would lay on me,&#8212;<BR>
The right and fortune of his happy stars;<BR>
Which God defend that I should wring from him!<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;<BR>
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,<BR>
All circumstances well considered.<BR>
You say that Edward is your brother's son:<BR>
So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;<BR>
For first was he contr&aacute;ct to Lady Lucy,&#8212;<BR>
Your mother lives a witness to his vow,&#8212;<BR>
And afterward by substitute betroth'd<BR>
To Bona, sister to the King of France.<BR>
These both put off, a poor petitioner,<BR>
A care-craz'd mother to a many sons,<BR>
A beauty-waning and distress&egrave;d widow,<BR>
Even in the afternoon of her best days,<BR>
Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye,<BR>
Seduc'd the pitch and height of his degree<BR>
To base declension and loath'd bigamy:<BR>
By her, in his unlawful bed, he got<BR>
This Edward, whom our manners call the prince.<BR>
More bitterly could I expostulate,<BR>
Save that, for reverence to some alive,<BR>
I give a sparing limit to my tongue.<BR>
Then, good my lord, take to your royal self<BR>
This proffer'd benefit of dignity;<BR>
If not to bless us and the land withal,<BR>
Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry<BR>
From the corruption of abusing time<BR>
Unto a lineal true-deriv&egrave;d course.<BR>
<BR>
MAYOR<BR>
Do, good my lord; your citizens entreat you.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.<BR>
<BR>
CATESBY<BR>
O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Alas, why would you heap those cares on me?<BR>
I am unfit for state and majesty:&#8212;<BR>
I do beseech you, take it not amiss:<BR>
I cannot nor I will not yield to you.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
If you refuse it,&#8212;as, in love and zeal,<BR>
Loath to depose the child, your brother's son&#8212;<BR>
As well we know your tenderness of heart<BR>
And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,<BR>
Which we have noted in you to your kindred,<BR>
And equally, indeed, to all estates,&#8212;<BR>
Yet know, whe'er you accept our suit or no,<BR>
Your brother's son shall never reign our king;<BR>
But we will plant some other in the throne,<BR>
To the disgrace and downfall of your house:<BR>
And in this resolution here we leave you.&#8212;<BR>
Come, citizens, we will entreat no more.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exeunt BUCKINGHAM, the MAYOR and citizens retiring.]</i></blockquote>

CATESBY<BR>
Call them again, sweet prince, accept their suit:<BR>
If you deny them, all the land will rue it.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Will you enforce me to a world of cares?<BR>
Call them again.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[CATESBY goes to the MAYOR, &amp;c., and then exit.]</i></blockquote>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not made of stone,<BR>
But penetrable to your kind entreaties,<BR>
Albeit against my conscience and my soul.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and CATESBY, MAYOR, &amp;c., coming forward.]</i></blockquote>

Cousin of Buckingham,&#8212;and sage grave men,<BR>
Since you will buckle fortune on my back,<BR>
To bear her burden, whe'er I will or no,<BR>
I must have patience to endure the load:<BR>
But if black scandal or foul-fac'd reproach<BR>
Attend the sequel of your imposition,<BR>
Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me<BR>
From all the impure blots and stains thereof;<BR>
For God doth know, and you may partly see,<BR>
How far I am from the desire of this.<BR>
<BR>
MAYOR<BR>
God bless your grace! we see it, and will say it.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
In saying so, you shall but say the truth.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Then I salute you with this royal title,&#8212;<BR>
Long live King Richard, England's worthy king!<BR>
<BR>
ALL<BR>
Amen.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
To-morrow may it please you to be crown'd?<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>
Even when you please, for you will have it so.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
To-morrow, then, we will attend your grace:<BR>
And so, most joyfully, we take our leave.<BR>
<BR>
GLOSTER<BR>

<blockquote><i>[To the BISHOPS.]</i></blockquote>

Come, let us to our holy work again.&#8212;<BR>
Farewell, my cousin;&#8212;farewell, gentle friends.<BR>

DUCHESS<BR>
Who meets us here?&#8212;my niece Plantagenet,<BR>
Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloster?<BR>
Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,<BR>
On pure heart's love, to greet the tender princes.&#8212;<BR>
Daughter, well met.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God give your graces both<BR>
A happy and a joyful time of day!<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
As much to you, good sister! Whither away?<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,<BR>
Upon the like devotion as yourselves,<BR>
To gratulate the gentle princes there.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Kind sister, thanks; we'll enter all together:&#8212;<BR>
And in good time, here the lieutenant comes.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Enter BRAKENBURY.]</i></blockquote>

Master Lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,<BR>
How doth the prince, and my young son of York?<BR>
<BR>
BRAKENBURY<BR>
Right well, dear madam. By your patience,<BR>
I may not suffer you to visit them.<BR>
The king hath strictly charg'd the contrary.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
The king! who's that?<BR>
<BR>
BRAKENBURY<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean the lord protector.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
The Lord protect him from that kingly title!<BR>
Hath he set bounds between their love and me?<BR>
I am their mother; who shall bar me from them?<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
I am their father's mother; I will see them.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother:<BR>
Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame,<BR>
And take thy office from thee on my peril.<BR>
<BR>
BRAKENBURY<BR>
No, madam, no,&#8212;I may not leave it so:<BR>
I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exit.]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>[Enter STANLEY.]</i></blockquote>

STANLEY<BR>
Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,<BR>
And I'll salute your grace of York as mother<BR>
And reverend looker-on of two fair queens.&#8212;<BR>

<blockquote><i>[To the DUCHESS OF GLOSTER.]</i></blockquote>

Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,<BR>
There to be crown&egrave;d Richard's royal queen.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Ah, cut my lace asunder,<BR>
That my pent heart may have some scope to beat,<BR>
Or else I swoon with this dead-killing news!<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!<BR>
<BR>
DORSET<BR>
Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace?<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee gone!<BR>
Death and destruction dog thee at thy heels;<BR>
Thy mother's name is ominous to children.<BR>
If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,<BR>
And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell:<BR>
Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,<BR>
Lest thou increase the number of the dead;<BR>
And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,<BR>
Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.<BR>
<BR>
STANLEY<BR>
Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.&#8212;<BR>
Take all the swift advantage of the hours;<BR>
You shall have letters from me to my son<BR>
In your behalf, to meet you on the way:<BR>
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
O ill-dispersing wind of misery!&#8212;<BR>
O my accurs&egrave;d womb, the bed of death!<BR>
A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,<BR>
Whose unavoided eye is murderous.<BR>
<BR>
STANLEY<BR>
Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
And I with all unwillingness will go.&#8212;<BR>
O, would to God that the inclusive verge<BR>
Of golden metal that must round my brow<BR>
Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain !<BR>
Anointed let me be with deadly venom,<BR>
And die ere men can say  God save the queen!<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Go, go, poor soul; I envy not thy glory;<BR>
To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
No, why?&#8212;When he that is my husband now<BR>
Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse;<BR>
When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands<BR>
Which issued from my other angel husband,<BR>
And that dear saint which then I weeping follow'd;<BR>
O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,<BR>
This was my wish,&#8212;"Be thou," quoth I, "accurs'd<BR>
For making me, so young, so old a widow!<BR>
And when thou wedd'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;<BR>
And be thy wife,&#8212;if any be so mad,&#8212;<BR>
More miserable by the life of thee<BR>
Than thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!"<BR>
Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,<BR>
Within so small a time, my woman's heart<BR>
Grossly grew captive to his honey words,<BR>
And prov'd the subject of mine own soul's curse,&#8212;<BR>
Which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest;<BR>
For never yet one hour in his bed<BR>
Did I enjoy the golden dew of sleep,<BR>
But with his timorous dreams was still awak'd.<BR>
Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;<BR>
And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
No more than with my soul I mourn for yours.<BR>
<BR>
DORSET<BR>
Farewell, thou woeful welcomer of glory!<BR>
<BR>
ANNE<BR>
Adieu, poor soul, that tak'st thy leave of it!<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>

<blockquote><i>[To DORSET]</i></blockquote>

Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee!&#8212;<BR>

<blockquote><i>[To ANNE]</i></blockquote>

Go thou to Richard, and good angels tend thee!&#8212;<BR>

<blockquote><i>[To QUEEN ELIZABETH]</i></blockquote>

Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess thee!<BR>
I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me!<BR>
Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,<BR>
And each hour's joy wreck'd with a week of teen.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Stay yet, look back with me unto the Tower.&#8212;<BR>
Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes<BR>
Whom envy hath immur'd within your walls!<BR>
Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!<BR>
Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow<BR>
For tender princes, use my babies well!<BR>
So foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell.<BR>

<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
My gracious sovereign?<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Give me thy hand.

But shall we wear these glories for a day?<BR>
Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Still live they, and for ever let them last!<BR>

KING RICHARD<BR>

Young Edward lives;&#8212;think now what I would speak.<BR>

Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.<BR>

True, noble prince.<BR>

KING RICHARD<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O bitter consequence,<BR>
That Edward still should live,&#8212;true, noble Prince!&#8212;<BR>
Cousin, thou wast not wont to be so dull:&#8212;<BR>
Shall I be plain?&#8212;I wish the bastards dead;<BR>
And I would have it suddenly perform'd.<BR>
What say'st thou now? speak suddenly, be brief.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Your grace may do your pleasure.<BR>

KING RICHARD<BR>
Tut, tut, thou art all ice, thy kindness freezes:<BR>
Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?<BR>

Before I positively speak in this:<BR>
I will resolve your grace immediately.<BR>

My lord?<BR>

KING RICHARD<BR>
Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold<BR>
Will tempt unto a close exploit of death?<BR>

I know a discontented gentleman<BR>
Whose humble means match not his haughty spirit:<BR>
Gold were as good as twenty orators,<BR>
And will, no doubt, tempt him to anything.<BR>

The deep-revolving witty Buckingham<BR>
No more shall be the neighbour to my counsels:<BR>
Hath he so long held out with me untir'd,<BR>
And stops he now for breath?&#8212;well, be it so.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Enter STANLEY.]</i></blockquote>

How now, Lord Stanley! what's the news?<BR>
<BR>
STANLEY<BR>
Know, my loving lord,<BR>
The Marquis Dorset, as I hear, is fled<BR>
To Richmond, in the parts where he abides.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Come hither, Catesby: rumour it abroad<BR>
That Anne, my wife, is very grievous sick;<BR>
I will take order for her keeping close:<BR>
Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman,<BR>
Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter;&#8212;<BR>
The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.&#8212;<BR>
Look how thou dream'st!&#8212;I say again, give out<BR>
That Anne, my queen, is sick and like to die:<BR>
About it; for it stands me much upon,<BR>
To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exit CATESBY.]</i></blockquote>

I must be married to my brother's daughter,<BR>
Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass:&#8212;<BR>
Murder her brothers, and then marry her!<BR>
Uncertain way of gain! But I am in<BR>
So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:<BR>
Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.<BR>

Why, then thou hast it: two deep enemies,<BR>
Foes to my rest, and my sweet sleep's disturbers,<BR>
Are they that I would have thee deal upon:&#8212;<BR>
Tyrell, I mean those bastards in the Tower.<BR>

Let me have open means to come to them,<BR>
And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.<BR>

Go, by this token:&#8212;rise, and lend thine ear:<BR>

BUCKINGHAM<BR>
My lord, I have consider'd in my mind<BR>
The late request that you did sound me in.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Well, let that rest. Dorset is fled to Richmond.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
I hear the news, my lord.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Stanley, he is your wife's son:&#8212;well, look to it.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
My lord, I claim the gift, my due by promise,<BR>
For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd:<BR>
The earldom of Hereford, and the movables<BR>
Which you have promis&egrave;d I shall possess.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Stanley, look to your wife: if she convey<BR>
Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
What says your highness to my just request?<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
I do remember me:&#8212;Henry the Sixth<BR>
Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,<BR>
When Richmond was a little peevish boy.<BR>
A king!&#8212;perhaps,&#8212;<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
My lord,&#8212;<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
How chance the prophet could not at that time<BR>
Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
My lord, your promise for the earldom,&#8212;<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Richmond!&#8212;When last I was at Exeter,<BR>
The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle<BR>
And call'd it Rougemount; at which name I started,<BR>
Because a bard of Ireland told me once<BR>
I should not live long after I saw Richmond.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
My lord&#8212;<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Ay, what's o'clock?<BR>

<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Upon the stroke of ten.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, let it strike.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Why let it strike?<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke<BR>
Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.<BR>
I am not in the giving vein to-day.<BR>
<BR>
BUCKINGHAM<BR>
Why then, resolve me whether you will or no.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Thou troublest me; I am not in the vein.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exeunt KING RICHARD and Train.]</i></blockquote>

BUCKINGHAM<BR>
And is it thus? repays he my deep service<BR>
With such contempt? made I him king for this?<BR>
O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone<BR>
To Brecknock while my fearful head is on!<BR>

Dighton and Forrest, who I did suborn<BR>
To do this piece of ruthless butchery,<BR>
Albeit they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,<BR>
Melted with tenderness and mild compassion,<BR>
Wept like two children in their deaths' sad story.<BR>
"O, thus," quoth Dighton, "lay the gentle babes,"&#8212;<BR>
"Thus, thus," quoth Forrest, "girdling one another<BR>
Within their alabaster innocent arms:<BR>
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,<BR>
And in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.<BR>
A book of prayers on their pillow lay;<BR>
Which once," quoth Forrest, "almost chang'd my mind;<BR>
But, O, the devil,"&#8212;there the villain stopp'd;<BR>
When Dighton thus told on:&#8212;"We smothered<BR>
The most replenish&egrave;d sweet work of nature<BR>
That from the prime creation e'er she framed."&#8212;<BR>
Hence both are gone; with conscience and remorse<BR>

Come to me, Tyrrel, soon, at after supper,<BR>

<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
So many miseries have craz'd my voice<BR>
That my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute.&#8212;<BR>
Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN MARGARET<BR>
Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet,<BR>
Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs,<BR>
And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?<BR>
When didst Thou sleep when such a deed was done?<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN MARGARET<BR>
When holy Harry died, and my sweet son.<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
Dead life, blind sight, poor mortal living ghost,<BR>
Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,<BR>
Brief abstract and rec&oacute;rd of tedious days,<BR>
Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Sitting down.]</i></blockquote>

Unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Ah, that thou wouldst as soon afford a grave<BR>
As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!<BR>
Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.<BR>
Ah, who hath any cause to mourn but we?<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Sitting down by her.]</i></blockquote>

QUEEN MARGARET<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Coming forward.]</i></blockquote>

If ancient sorrow be most reverent,<BR>
Give mine the benefit of seniory,<BR>
And let my griefs frown on the upper hand.<BR>
If sorrow can admit society,<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Sitting down with them.]</i></blockquote>

Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:&#8212;<BR>
I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;<BR>
I had a Henry, till a Richard kill'd him:<BR>
Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;<BR>
Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard kill'd him.<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;<BR>
I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN MARGARET<BR>
Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.<BR>
From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept<BR>
A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:<BR>
That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,<BR>
To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood;<BR>
That foul defacer of God's handiwork;<BR>
That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,<BR>
That reigns in gall&egrave;d eyes of weeping souls,&#8212;<BR>
Thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves.&#8212;<BR>
O upright, just, and true-disposing God,<BR>
How do I thank Thee that this carnal cur<BR>
Preys on the issue of his mother's body,<BR>
And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!<BR>
God witness with me, I have wept for thine.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN MARGARET<BR>
Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,<BR>
And now I cloy me with beholding it.<BR>
Thy Edward he is dead, that kill'd my Edward;<BR>
The other Edward dead to quit my Edward;<BR>
Young York he is but boot, because both they<BR>
Match not the high perfection of my loss:<BR>
Thy Clarence he is dead that stabb'd my Edward;<BR>
And the beholders of this frantic play,<BR>
The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,<BR>
Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.<BR>
Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer;<BR>
Only reserv'd their factor to buy souls,<BR>
And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,<BR>
Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:<BR>
Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray,<BR>
To have him suddenly convey'd from hence.&#8212;<BR>
Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I pray,<BR>
That I may live to say "The dog is dead."<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
O, thou didst prophesy the time would come<BR>
That I should wish for thee to help me curse<BR>
That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN MARGARET<BR>
I call'd thee then, vain flourish of my fortune;<BR>
I call'd thee then, poor shadow, painted queen;<BR>
The presentation of but what I was,<BR>
The flattering index of a direful pageant;<BR>
One heav'd a-high to be hurl'd down below,<BR>
A mother only mock'd with two fair babes;<BR>
A dream of what thou wast; a garish flag,<BR>
To be the aim of every dangerous shot;<BR>
A sign of dignity, a breath, a bubble;<BR>
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.<BR>
Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?<BR>
Where be thy two sons? wherein dost thou joy?<BR>
Who sues, and kneels, and says, "God save the queen?"<BR>
Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?<BR>
Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?<BR>
Decline all this, and see what now thou art:<BR>
For happy wife, a most distress&egrave;d widow;<BR>
For joyful mother, one that wails the name;<BR>
For one being su'd to, one that humbly sues;<BR>
For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;<BR>
For she that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;<BR>
For she being fear'd of all, now fearing one;<BR>
For she commanding all, obey'd of none.<BR>
Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about<BR>
And left thee but a very prey to time;<BR>
Having no more but thought of what thou wast,<BR>
To torture thee the more, being what thou art.<BR>
Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not<BR>
Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?<BR>
Now thy proud neck bears half my burden'd yoke;<BR>
From which even here I slip my weary head,<BR>
And leave the burden of it all on thee.<BR>
Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance:&#8212;<BR>
These English woes shall make me smile in France.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,<BR>
And teach me how to curse mine enemies!<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN MARGARET<BR>
Forbear to sleep the night, and fast the day;<BR>
Compare dead happiness with living woe;<BR>
Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were,<BR>
And he that slew them fouler than he is;<BR>
Bettering thy loss makes the bad-causer worse;<BR>
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine!<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN MARGARET<BR>
Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exit.]</i></blockquote>

DUCHESS<BR>
Why should calamity be full of words?<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Windy attorneys to their client woes,<BR>
Airy succeeders of intestate joys,<BR>
Poor breathing orators of miseries!<BR>
Let them have scope: though what they do impart<BR>
Help nothing else, yet do they ease the heart.<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me,<BR>
And in the breath of bitter words let's smother<BR>
My damn&egrave;d son, that thy two sweet sons smother'd.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Drum within]</i></blockquote>

I hear his drum:&#8212;be copious in exclaims.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Enter KING RICHARD and his Train, marching.]</i></blockquote>

KING RICHARD<BR>
Who intercepts me in my expedition?<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
O, she that might have intercepted thee,<BR>
By strangling thee in her accurs&egrave;d womb,<BR>
From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown,<BR>
Where should be branded, if that right were right,<BR>
The slaughter of the prince that ow'd that crown,<BR>
And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers?<BR>
Tell me, thou villain-slave, where are my children?<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?<BR>
And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Where is the gentle Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
Where is kind Hastings?<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!<BR>
Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women<BR>
Rail on the Lord's anointed: strike, I say!<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Flourish. Alarums.]</i></blockquote>

Either be patient and entreat me fair,<BR>
Or with the clamorous report of war<BR>
Thus will I drown your exclamations.<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
Art thou my son?<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
Then patiently hear my impatience.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Madam, I have a touch of your condition<BR>
That cannot brook the accent of reproof.<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
O, let me speak!<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do, then; but I'll not hear.<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
I will be mild and gentle in my words.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,<BR>
God knows, in torment and in agony.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
And came I not at last to comfort you?<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well<BR>
Thou cam'st on earth to make the earth my hell.<BR>
A grievous burden was thy birth to me;<BR>
Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;<BR>
Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious;<BR>
Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous;<BR>
Thy age confirm'd, proud, subtle, sly, and bloody,<BR>
More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:<BR>
What comfortable hour canst thou name<BR>
That ever grac'd me with thy company?<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Faith, none but Humphrey Hour, that call'd your grace<BR>
To breakfast once forth of my company.<BR>
If I be so disgracious in your eye,<BR>
Let me march on and not offend you, madam.&#8212;<BR>
Strike up the drum.<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pr'ythee hear me speak.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
You speak too bitterly.<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear me a word;<BR>
For I shall never speak to thee again.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
So.<BR>
<BR>
DUCHESS<BR>
Either thou wilt die by God's just ordinance<BR>
Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror;<BR>
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish<BR>
And never more behold thy face again.<BR>
Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse;<BR>
Which in the day of battle tire thee more<BR>
Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!<BR>
My prayers on the adverse party fight;<BR>
And there the little souls of Edward's children<BR>
Whisper the spirits of thine enemies,<BR>
And promise them success and victory.<BR>
Bloody thou art; bloody will be thy end:<BR>
Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exit.]</i></blockquote>

QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse<BR>
Abides in me; I say amen to her.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Going.]</i></blockquote>

KING RICHARD<BR>
Stay, madam, I must talk a word with you.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
I have no more sons of the royal blood<BR>
For thee to slaughter: for my daughters, Richard,&#8212;<BR>
They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;<BR>
And therefore level not to hit their lives.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth.<BR>
Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
And must she die for this? O, let her live,<BR>
And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty:<BR>
Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;<BR>
Throw over her the veil of infamy:<BR>
So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,<BR>
I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Wrong not her birth; she is of royal blood.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
To save her life I'll say she is not so.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Her life is safest only in her birth.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
And only in that safety died her brothers.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
All unavoided is the doom of destiny.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
True, when avoided grace makes destiny:<BR>
My babes were destined to a fairer death,<BR>
If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd<BR>
Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.<BR>
Whose hand soever lanc'd their tender hearts,<BR>
Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:<BR>
No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt<BR>
Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,<BR>
To revel in the entrails of my lambs.<BR>
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,<BR>
My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys<BR>
Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;<BR>
And I, in such a desperate bay of death,<BR>
Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,<BR>
Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise<BR>
And dangerous success of bloody wars,<BR>
As I intend more good to you and yours<BR>
Than ever you or yours by me were harm'd!<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,<BR>
To be discover'd, that can do me good?<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Advancement of your children, gentle lady.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Unto the dignity and height of honour,<BR>
The high imperial type of this earth's glory.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Flatter my sorrows with report of it;<BR>
Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,<BR>
Canst thou demise to any child of mine?<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Even all I have; ay, and myself and all<BR>
Will I withal endow a child of thine;<BR>
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul<BR>
Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs<BR>
Which thou supposest I have done to thee.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Be brief, lest that the process of thy kindness<BR>
Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
What do you think?<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:<BR>
So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;<BR>
And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:<BR>
I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter,<BR>
And do intend to make her Queen of England.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Well, then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Even he that makes her queen: who else should be?<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
What, thou?<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
I, even I: what think you of it, madam?<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
How canst thou woo her?<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would I learn of you<BR>
As one being best acquainted with her humour.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
And wilt thou learn of me?<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam, with all my heart.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,<BR>
A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave<BR>
"Edward" and "York." Then haply will she weep:<BR>
Therefore present to her,&#8212;as sometimes Margaret<BR>
Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,&#8212;<BR>
A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain<BR>
The purple sap from her sweet brothers' bodies,<BR>
And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal.<BR>
If this inducement move her not to love,<BR>
Send her a letter of thy noble deeds;<BR>
Tell her thou mad'st away her uncle Clarence,<BR>
Her uncle Rivers; ay, and for her sake<BR>
Mad'st quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
You mock me, madam; this is not the way<BR>
To win your daughter.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no other way;<BR>
Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,<BR>
And not be Richard that hath done all this.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Say that I did all this for love of her?<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,<BR>
Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Look, what is done cannot be now amended:<BR>
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,<BR>
Which after-hours gives leisure to repent.<BR>
If I did take the kingdom from your sons,<BR>
To make amends I'll give it to your daughter.<BR>
If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,<BR>
To quicken your increase I will beget<BR>
Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter.<BR>
A grandam's name is little less in love<BR>
Than is the doating title of a mother;<BR>
They are as children but one step below,<BR>
Even of your mettle, of your very blood;<BR>
Of all one pain,&#8212;save for a night of groans<BR>
Endur'd of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.<BR>
Your children were vexation to your youth;<BR>
But mine shall be a comfort to your age.<BR>
The loss you have is but a son being king,<BR>
And by that loss your daughter is made queen.<BR>
I cannot make you what amends I would,<BR>
Therefore accept such kindness as I can.<BR>
Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul<BR>
Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,<BR>
This fair alliance quickly shall call home<BR>
To high promotions and great dignity:<BR>
The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife,<BR>
Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;<BR>
Again shall you be mother to a king,<BR>
And all the ruins of distressful times<BR>
Repair'd with double riches of content.<BR>
What! we have many goodly days to see:<BR>
The liquid drops of tears that you have shed<BR>
Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,<BR>
Advantaging their loan with interest<BR>
Of ten times double gain of happiness.<BR>
Go, then, my mother, to thy daughter go;<BR>
Make bold her bashful years with your experience;<BR>
Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale:<BR>
Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame<BR>
Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess<BR>
With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys:<BR>
And when this arm of mine hath chastised<BR>
The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,<BR>
Bound with triumphant garlands will I come,<BR>
And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;<BR>
To whom I will retail my conquest won,<BR>
And she shall be sole victoress, Caesar's Caesar.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
What were I best to say? her father's brother<BR>
Would be her lord? or shall I say her uncle?<BR>
Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles?<BR>
Under what title shall I woo for thee,<BR>
That God, the law, my honour, and her love<BR>
Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Which she shall purchase with still-lasting war.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Tell her the king, that may command, entreats.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
That at her hands which the king's King forbids.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Say she shall be a high and mighty queen.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
To wail the title, as her mother doth.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Say I will love her everlastingly.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
But how long shall that title, "ever," last?<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
But how long fairly shall her sweet life last?<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
As long as heaven and nature lengthens it.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
As long as hell and Richard likes of it.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Say I, her sovereign, am her subject low.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Be eloquent in my behalf to her.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Then plainly to her tell my loving tale.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
O, no, my reasons are too deep and dead;&#8212;<BR>
Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their graves.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Harp on it still shall I till heartstrings break.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,&#8212;<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
Profan'd, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
I swear,&#8212;<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By nothing; for this is no oath:<BR>
Thy George, profan'd, hath lost his lordly honour;<BR>
Thy garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;<BR>
Thy crown, usurp'd, disgrac'd his kingly glory.<BR>
If something thou wouldst swear to be believ'd,<BR>
Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Now, by the world,&#8212;<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
My father's death,&#8212;<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy life hath that dishonour'd.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Then, by myself,&#8212;<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy self is self-misus'd.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Why, then, by God,&#8212;<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's wrong is most of all.<BR>
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,<BR>
The unity the king thy brother made<BR>
Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:<BR>
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,<BR>
The imperial metal, circling now thy head,<BR>
Had grac'd the tender temples of my child;<BR>
And both the princes had been breathing here,<BR>
Which now, two tender bedfellows for dust,<BR>
Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.<BR>
What canst thou swear by now?<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time to come.<BR>
<BR>
QUEEN ELIZABETH<BR>
That thou hast wrong&egrave;d in the time o'erpast;<BR>
For I myself have many tears to wash<BR>
Hereafter time, for time past wronged by thee.<BR>

KING RICHARD<BR>
As I intend to prosper and repent!<BR>
So thrive I in my dangerous attempt<BR>

Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!<BR>
Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!<BR>
Be opposite all planets of good luck<BR>
To my proceeding!&#8212;if, with pure heart's love,<BR>
Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,<BR>
I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!<BR>
In her consists my happiness and thine;<BR>
Without her, follows to myself and thee,<BR>
Herself, the land, and many a Christian soul,<BR>
Death, desolation, ruin, and decay:<BR>
It cannot be avoided but by this;<BR>
It will not be avoided but by this.<BR>
Therefore, dear mother,&#8212;I must call you so,&#8212;<BR>
Be the attorney of my love to her:<BR>
Plead what I will be, not what I have been;<BR>
Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:<BR>
Urge the necessity and state of times,<BR>
And be not peevish found in great designs.<BR>

How now! what news?<BR>
<BR>
RATCLIFF<BR>
Most mighty sovereign, on the western coast<BR>
Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore<BR>
Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,<BR>
Unarm'd, and unresolv'd to beat them back:<BR>
'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;<BR>
And there they hull, expecting but the aid<BR>
Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk:&#8212;<BR>
Ratcliff, thyself,&#8212;or Catesby; where is he?<BR>
<BR>
CATESBY<BR>
Here, my good lord.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Catesby, fly to the duke.<BR>

Why stay'st thou here, and go'st not to the duke?<BR>
<BR>
CATESBY<BR>
First, mighty liege, tell me your highness' pleasure,<BR>
What from your grace I shall deliver to him.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
O, true, good Catesby:&#8212;bid him levy straight<BR>
The greatest strength and power that he can make,<BR>
And meet me suddenly at Salisbury.<BR>

CATESBY<BR>
I go.<BR>

Your highness told me I should post before.<BR>

STANLEY<BR>
None good, my liege, to please you with the hearing;<BR>
Nor none so bad but well may be reported.<BR>

<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
There let him sink, and be the seas on him!<BR>
White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?<BR>
<BR>
STANLEY<BR>
I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Well, as you guess?<BR>
<BR>
STANLEY<BR>
Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Morton,<BR>
He makes for England here, to claim the crown.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd?<BR>
Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd?<BR>
What heir of York is there alive but we?<BR>
And who is England's king but great York's heir?<BR>
Then tell me, what makes he upon the seas?<BR>
<BR>
STANLEY<BR>
Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Unless for that he comes to be your liege,<BR>
You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.<BR>
Thou wilt revolt and fly to him, I fear.<BR>
<BR>
STANLEY<BR>
No, mighty leige; therefore mistrust me not.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?<BR>
Where be thy tenants and thy followers?<BR>
Are they not now upon the western shore,<BR>
Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships?<BR>
<BR>
STANLEY<BR>
No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Cold friends to me: what do they in the north,<BR>
When they should serve their sovereign in the west?<BR>
<BR>
STANLEY<BR>
They have not been commanded, mighty king:<BR>
Pleaseth your majesty to give me leave,<BR>
I'll muster up my friends, and meet your grace<BR>
Where and what time your majesty shall please.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Ay, ay, thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond;<BR>
But I'll not trust thee.<BR>
<BR>
STANLEY<BR>

You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful:<BR>
I never was nor never will be false.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Go, then, and muster men. But leave behind<BR>
Your son, George Stanley: look your heart be firm,<BR>
Or else his head's assurance is but frail.<BR>
<BR>
STANLEY<BR>
So deal with him as I prove true to you.<BR>

Richmond, in Dorsetshire, sent out a boat<BR>
Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks<BR>
If they were his assistants, yea or no;<BR>
Who answer'd him they came from Buckingham<BR>
Upon his party. He, mistrusting them,<BR>
Hois'd sail, and made his course again for Britagne.<BR>

KING RICHARD<BR>
March on, march on, since we are up in arms;<BR>
If not to fight with foreign enemies,<BR>
Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.<BR>

Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.<BR>

<i>[To KING RICHARD.]</i> Let me sit heavy in thy soul to-morrow,<BR>
Rivers that died at Pomfret! despair and die!<BR>
<BR>
GHOST OF GREY<BR>
<i>[To KING RICHARD.]</i> Think upon Grey, and let thy soul despair!<BR>
<BR>
GHOST OF VAUGHAN<BR>
<i>[To KING RICHARD.]</i> Think upon Vaughan, and, with guilty fear,<BR>
Let fall thy lance: despair and die!&#8212;<BR>
<BR>
ALL THREE<BR>
<i>[To RICHMOND.]</i> Awake, and think our wrongs in Richard's bosom<BR>
Will conquer him!&#8212;awake, and win the day!<BR>

<blockquote><i>[The GHOST of HASTINGS rises.]</i></blockquote>

GHOST<BR>
<i>[To KING RICHARD.]</i> Bloody and guilty, guiltily awake,<BR>
And in a bloody battle end thy days!<BR>
Think on Lord Hastings: despair and die!&#8212;<BR>
<i>[To RICHMOND.]</i> Quiet untroubled soul, awake, awake!<BR>
Arm, fight, and conquer, for fair England's sake!<BR>

<blockquote><i>[The Ghosts of the two young PRINCES rise.]</i></blockquote>

GHOSTS<BR>
<i>[To KING RICHARD.]</i> Dream on thy cousins smothered in the Tower:<BR>
Let us be lead within thy bosom, Richard,<BR>
And weigh thee down to ruin, shame, and death!<BR>
Thy nephews' souls bid thee despair and die!&#8212;<BR>
<i>[To RICHMOND.]</i> Sleep, Richmond, sleep in peace, and wake in joy;<BR>
Good angels guard thee from the boar's annoy!<BR>
Live, and beget a happy race of kings!<BR>
Edward's unhappy sons do bid thee flourish.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[The GHOST of QUEEN ANNE rises.]</i></blockquote>

GHOST<BR>
<i>[To KING RICHARD.]</i> Richard, thy wife, that wretched Anne thy wife,<BR>
That never slept a quiet hour with thee,<BR>
Now fills thy sleep with perturbations:<BR>
To-morrow in the battle think on me,<BR>
And fall thy edgeless sword: despair and die!&#8212;<BR>
<i>[To RICHMOND.]</i> Thou quiet soul, sleep thou a quiet sleep;<BR>
Dream of success and happy victory:<BR>
Thy adversary's wife doth pray for thee.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[The Ghost of BUCKINGHAM rises.]</i></blockquote>

GHOST<BR>
<i>[To KING RICHARD.]</i> The first was I that help'd thee to the crown;<BR>
The last was I that felt thy tyranny:<BR>
O, in the battle think on Buckingham,<BR>
And die in terror of thy guiltiness!<BR>
Dream on, dream on of bloody deeds and death:<BR>
Fainting, despair; despairing, yield thy breath!&#8212;<BR>
<i>[To RICHMOND.]</i> I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid:<BR>
But cheer thy heart and be thou not dismay'd:<BR>
God and good angels fight on Richmond's side;<BR>
And Richard falls in height of all his pride.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[The GHOSTS vanish. KING RICHARD starts out of his dream.]</i></blockquote>

KING RICHARD<BR>
Give me another horse,&#8212;bind up my wounds,&#8212;<BR>
Have mercy, Jesu!&#8212;Soft! I did but dream.&#8212;<BR>
O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!&#8212;<BR>
The lights burn blue.&#8212;It is now dead midnight.<BR>
Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.<BR>
What, do I fear myself? there's none else by:<BR>
Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.<BR>
Is there a murderer here? No;&#8212;yes, I am:<BR>
Then fly. What, from myself? Great reason why,&#8212;<BR>
Lest I revenge. What,&#8212;myself upon myself!<BR>
Alack, I love myself. Wherefore? for any good<BR>
That I myself have done unto myself?<BR>
O, no! alas, I rather hate myself<BR>
For hateful deeds committed by myself!<BR>
I am a villain: yet I lie, I am not.<BR>
Fool, of thyself speak well:&#8212;fool, do not flatter.<BR>
My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,<BR>
And every tongue brings in a several tale,<BR>
And every tale condemns me for a villain.<BR>
Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree;<BR>
Murder, stern murder, in the dir'st degree;<BR>
All several sins, all us'd in each degree,<BR>
Throng to the bar, crying all "Guilty! Guilty!"<BR>
I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;<BR>
And if I die no soul will pity me:<BR>
And wherefore should they,&#8212;since that I myself<BR>
Find in myself no pity to myself?<BR>
Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd<BR>
Came to my tent; and every one did threat<BR>
To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Enter RATCLIFF.]</i></blockquote>

RATCLIFF<BR>
My lord,&#8212;<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Who's there?<BR>
<BR>
RATCLIFF<BR>
Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The early village-cock<BR>
Hath twice done salutation to the morn;<BR>
Your friends are up, and buckle on their armour.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!&#8212;<BR>
What think'st thou,&#8212;will our friends prove all true?<BR>
<BR>
RATCLIFF<BR>
No doubt, my lord.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear,&#8212;<BR>
<BR>
RATCLIFF<BR>
Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night<BR>
Have stuck more terror to the soul of Richard<BR>
Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers<BR>
Arm&egrave;d in proof and led by shallow Richmond.<BR>
It is not yet near day. Come, go with me;<BR>
Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,<BR>
To see if any mean to shrink from me.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exeunt KING RICHARD and RATCLIFF.]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>[RICHMOND wakes. Enter OXFORD and others.]</i></blockquote>

LORDS<BR>
Good morrow, Richmond!<BR>
<BR>
RICHMOND<BR>
Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,<BR>
That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.<BR>
<BR>
LORDS<BR>
How have you slept, my lord?<BR>
<BR>
RICHMOND<BR>
The sweetest sleep and fairest-boding dreams<BR>
That ever enter'd in a drowsy head<BR>
Have I since your departure had, my lords.<BR>
Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murder'd<BR>
Came to my tent and cried on victory:<BR>
I promise you, my heart is very jocund<BR>
In the remembrance of so fair a dream.<BR>
How far into the morning is it, lords?<BR>
<BR>
LORDS<BR>
Upon the stroke of four.<BR>
<BR>
RICHMOND<BR>
Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.&#8212;<BR>

<blockquote><i>[He advances to the Troops.]</i></blockquote>

More than I have said, loving countrymen,<BR>
The leisure and enforcement of the time<BR>
Forbids to dwell on: yet remember this,&#8212;<BR>
God and our good cause fight upon our side;<BR>
The prayers of holy saints and wrong&egrave;d souls,<BR>
Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;<BR>
Richard except, those whom we fight against<BR>
Had rather have us win than him they follow:<BR>
For what is he they follow? truly, gentlemen,<BR>
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;<BR>
One rais'd in blood, and one in blood establish'd;<BR>
One that made means to come by what he hath,<BR>
And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him;<BR>
A base foul stone, made precious by the foil<BR>
Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;<BR>
One that hath ever been God's enemy.<BR>
Then, if you fight against God's enemy,<BR>
God will, in justice, ward you as His soldiers;<BR>
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,<BR>
You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;<BR>
If you do fight against your country's foes,<BR>
Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;<BR>
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,<BR>
Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;<BR>
If you do free your children from the sword,<BR>
Your children's children quit it in your age.<BR>
Then, in the name of God and all these rights,<BR>
Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.<BR>
For me, the ransom of my bold attempt<BR>
Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;<BR>
But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt<BR>
The least of you shall share his part thereof.<BR>
Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;<BR>
God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Exeunt.]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>[Re-enter KING RICHARD, RATCLIFF, Attendants, and Forces.]</i></blockquote>

KING RICHARD<BR>
What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?<BR>
<BR>
RATCLIFF<BR>
That he was never train&egrave;d up in arms.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
He said the truth; and what said Surrey then?<BR>
<BR>
RATCLIFF<BR>
He smil'd, and said, "the better for our purpose."<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
He was in the right; and so indeed it is.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Clock strikes.]</i></blockquote>

Tell the clock there.&#8212;Give me a calendar.&#8212;<BR>
Who saw the sun to-day?<BR>
<BR>
RATCLIFF<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not I, my lord.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Then he disdains to shine; for by the book<BR>
He should have brav'd the east an hour ago:<BR>
A black day will it be to somebody.&#8212;<BR>
Ratcliff,&#8212;<BR>
<BR>
RATCLIFF<BR>
My lord?<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun will not be seen to-day;<BR>
The sky doth frown and lower upon our army.<BR>
I would these dewy tears were from the ground.<BR>
Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me<BR>
More than to Richmond? for the selfsame heaven<BR>
That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Enter NORFOLK.]</i></blockquote>

NORFOLK<BR>
Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse;&#8212;<BR>
Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power:<BR>
I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,<BR>
And thus my battle shall be ordered:&#8212;<BR>
My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,<BR>
Consisting equally of horse and foot;<BR>
Our archers shall be plac&egrave;d in the midst:<BR>
John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,<BR>
Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.<BR>
They thus directed, we will follow<BR>
In the main battle; whose puissance on either side<BR>
Shall be well wing&egrave;d with our chiefest horse.<BR>
This, and Saint George to boot!&#8212;What think'st thou,<BR>
Norfolk?<BR>
<BR>
NORFOLK<BR>
A good direction, warlike sovereign.&#8212;<BR>
This found I on my tent this morning.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Giving a scroll.]</i></blockquote>

KING RICHARD<BR>
<i>[Reads.]</i> "Jockey of Norfolk, be not too bold,<BR>
For Dickon thy master is bought and sold."<BR>
A thing devis&egrave;d by the enemy.&#8212;<BR>
Go, gentlemen, every man unto his charge:<BR>
Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls;<BR>
Conscience is but a word that cowards use,<BR>
Devis'd at first to keep the strong in awe:<BR>
Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law.<BR>
March on, join bravely, let us to't pell-mell;<BR>
If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.&#8212;<BR>
What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?<BR>
Remember whom you are to cope withal;&#8212;<BR>
A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,<BR>
A scum of Britagnes, and base lackey peasants,<BR>
Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth<BR>
To desperate adventures and assur'd destruction.<BR>
You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;<BR>
You having lands, and bless'd with beauteous wives,<BR>
They would restrain the one, distain the other.<BR>
And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,<BR>
Long kept in Britagne at our mother's cost?<BR>
A milk-sop, one that never in his life<BR>
Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?<BR>
Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again;<BR>
Lash hence these over-weening rags of France,<BR>
These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;<BR>
Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,<BR>
For want of means, poor rats, had hang'd themselves:<BR>
If we be conquered, let men conquer us,<BR>
And not these bastard Britagnes, whom our fathers<BR>
Have in their own land beaten, bobb'd, and thump'd,<BR>
And, on rec&oacute;rd, left them the heirs of shame.<BR>
Shall these enjoy our lands? lie with our wives,<BR>
Ravish our daughters?&#8212;Hark! I hear their drum.<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Drum afar off.]</i></blockquote>

Fight, gentlemen of England! fight, bold yeomen!<BR>
Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head!<BR>
Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood;<BR>
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Enter a MESSENGER.]</i></blockquote>

What says Lord Stanley? will he bring his power?<BR>
<BR>
MESSENGER<BR>
My lord, he doth deny to come.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Off with his son George's head!<BR>
<BR>
NORFOLK<BR>
My lord, the enemy is pass'd the marsh:<BR>
After the battle let George Stanley die.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
A thousand hearts are great within my bosom:<BR>
Advance our standards, set upon our foes;<BR>
Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,<BR>
Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!<BR>
Upon them! Victory sits on our helms.<BR>

CATESBY<BR>
Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!<BR>
The king enacts more wonders than a man,<BR>
Daring an opposite to every danger:<BR>
His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,<BR>
Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.<BR>
Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!<BR>

<blockquote><i>[Alarum. Enter KING RICHARD.]</i></blockquote>

KING RICHARD<BR>
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!<BR>
<BR>
CATESBY<BR>
Withdraw, my lord! I'll help you to a horse.<BR>
<BR>
KING RICHARD<BR>
Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,<BR>
And I will stand the hazard of the die:<BR>
I think there be six Richmonds in the field:<BR>
Five have I slain to-day instead of him.&#8212;<BR>
A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!<BR>

RICHMOND<BR>
God and your arms be prais'd, victorious friends;<BR>
The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.<BR>
<BR>
STANLEY<BR>
Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee!<BR>
Lo, here, this long-usurp&egrave;d royalty<BR>
From the dead temples of this bloody wretch<BR>
Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal.<BR>
Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.<BR>
<BR>
RICHMOND<BR>
Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!&#8212;<BR>
But, tell me is young George Stanley living?<BR>

STANLEY<BR>
He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town,<BR>
Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.<BR>

RICHMOND<BR>

<BR>
STANLEY<BR>
John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,<BR>
Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.<BR>
<BR>
RICHMOND<BR>
Inter their bodies as becomes their births:<BR>
Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled<BR>
That in submission will return to us:<BR>
And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,<BR>
We will unite the white rose and the red:&#8212;<BR>
Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,<BR>
That long have frown'd upon their emnity!<BR>
What traitor hears me, and says not Amen?<BR>
England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;<BR>
The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,<BR>
The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,<BR>
The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire:<BR>
All this divided York and Lancaster,<BR>
Divided in their dire division,&#8212;<BR>
O, now let Richmond and Elizabeth,<BR>
The true succeeders of each royal house,<BR>
By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!<BR>
And let their heirs,&#8212;God, if Thy will be so,&#8212;<BR>
Enrich the time to come with smooth'd-fac'd peace,<BR>
With smiling plenty, and fair prosperous days!<BR>
Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,<BR>
That would reduce these bloody days again,<BR>
And make poor England weep in streams of blood!<BR>
Let them not live to taste this land's increase<BR>
That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!<BR>
Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:<BR>
That she may long live here, God say Amen!<BR>
